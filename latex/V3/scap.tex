The TME cellular composition can be inferred from gene expression data since host cell RNA is sequenced along with the cancer cell RNA. Not accounting for the immune signal when performing gene expression analysis may confound the interpretation of clustering results \cite{aranXCellDigitallyPortraying2017, rheeImpactTumorPurity2018, hoadleyCellofOriginPatternsDominate2018}.
