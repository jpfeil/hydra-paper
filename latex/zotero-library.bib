  abstract = {Transposable elements (TEs) represent a substantial fraction of many eukaryotic genomes, and transcriptional regulation of these factors is important to determine TE activities in human cells. However, due to the repetitive nature of TEs, identifying transcription factor (TF)-binding sites from ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-seq) datasets is challenging. Current algorithms are focused on subtle differences between TE copies and thus bias the analysis to relatively old and inactive TEs. Here we describe an approach termed ``MapRRCon'' (mapping repeat reads to a consensus) which allows us to identify proteins binding to TE DNA sequences by mapping ChIP-seq reads to the TE consensus sequence after whole-genome alignment. Although this method does not assign binding sites to individual insertions in the genome, it provides a landscape of interacting TFs by capturing factors that bind to TEs under various conditions. We applied this method to screen TFs' interaction with L1 in human cells/tissues using ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets and identified 178 of the 512 TFs tested as bound to L1 in at least one biological condition with most of them (138) localized to the promoter. Among these L1-binding factors, we focused on Myc and CTCF, as they play important roles in cancer progression and 3D chromatin structure formation. Furthermore, we explored the transcriptomes of The Cancer Genome Atlas breast and ovarian tumor samples in which a consistent anti-/correlation between L1 and Myc/CTCF expression was observed, suggesting that these two factors may play roles in regulating L1 transcription during the development of such tumors.},

  abstract = {Background
A large portion of intronic and intergenic space in our genome consists of repeated sequences. One of the most prevalent is the Long INterspersed Element-1 (LINE-1, L1) mobile DNA. LINE-1 is rightly receiving increasing interest as a cancer biomarker.

Content
Intact LINE-1 elements are self-propagating. They code for RNA and proteins which function to make more copies of the genomic element. Our current understanding is that this process is repressed in most normal cells, but that LINE-1 expression is a hallmark of many types of malignancy. Here, we will consider features of cancer cells when cellular defense mechanisms repressing LINE-1 go awry. We will review evidence that genomic LINE-1 methylation, LINE-1-encoded RNAs, and LINE-1 open reading frame 1 protein (ORF1p) may be useful in cancer diagnosis.

Summary
The repetitive and variable nature of LINE-1 DNA sequences pose unique challenges to studying them, but recent advances in reagents and next generation sequencing present opportunities to characterize LINE-1 expression and activity in cancers, and identify clinical applications.},

  volume = {6},
  issn = {2326-6074},
  abstract = {Surgical archives of tumor specimens are often impure. The presence of RNA transcripts from nontumor cells, such as immune and stromal cells, can impede analyses of cancer expression profiles. To systematically analyze the impact of tumor purity, the gene expression profiles and tumor purities were obtained for 7,794 tumor specimens across 21 tumor types (available in The Cancer Genome Atlas consortium). First, we observed that genes with roles in immunity and oxidative phosphorylation were significantly inversely correlated and correlated with the tumor purity, respectively. The expression of genes implicated in immunotherapy and specific immune cell genes, along with the abundance of immune cell infiltrates, was substantially inversely correlated with tumor purity. This relationship may explain the correlation between immune gene expression and mutation burden, highlighting the need to account for tumor purity in the evaluation of expression markers obtained from bulk tumor transcriptome data. Second, examination of cluster membership of gene pairs, with or without controlling for tumor purity, revealed that tumor purity may have a substantial impact on gene clustering across tumor types. Third, feature genes for molecular taxonomy were analyzed for correlation with tumor purity, and for some tumor types, feature genes representing the mesenchymal and classical subtypes were inversely correlated and correlated with tumor purity, respectively. Our findings indicate that tumor purity is an important confounder in evaluating the correlation between gene expression and clinicopathologic features such as mutation burden, as well as gene clustering and molecular taxonomy.

The influence of cell type was evident in DNA-methylation-based clustering, even after excluding sites with known preexisting tissue-type-specific methylation. Integrative clustering further emphasized the dominant role of cell-of-origin patterns. Molecular similarities among histologically or anatomically related cancer types provide a basis for focused pan-cancer analyses, such as pan-gastrointestinal, pan-gynecological, pan-kidney, and pan-squamous cancers, and those related by stemness features, which in turn may inform strategies for future therapeutic development.},

Alternatively, total RNA expression reveals distinct repeat coexpression subgroups and delivers greater dynamic changes, implying they may serve as better biomarkers of clinical outcomes. We show that endogenous retrovirus expression predicts immunotherapy response better than conventional immune signatures in one cohort yet is not predictive in another. Moreover, we find that global repeat derepression, including the HSATII satellite repeat, correlates with an immunosuppressive phenotype in colorectal and pancreatic tumors and validate in situ. In conclusion, we stress the importance of analyzing the full spectrum of repeat transcription to decode their role in tumor immunity.},

  abstract = {Although the use of clustering methods has rapidly become one of the standard computational approaches in the literature of microarray gene expression data, little attention has been paid to uncertainty in the results obtained. Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) models provide a nonparametric Bayesian alternative to the bootstrap approach to modeling uncertainty in gene expression clustering. Most previously published applications of Bayesian model-based clustering methods have been to short time series data. In this paper, we present a case study of the application of nonparametric Bayesian clustering methods to the clustering of high-dimensional nontime series gene expression data using full Gaussian covariances. We use the probability that two genes belong to the same cluster in a DPM model as a measure of the similarity of these gene expression profiles. Conversely, this probability can be used to define a dissimilarity measure, which, for the purposes of visualization, can be input to one of the standard linkage algorithms used for hierarchical clustering. Biologically plausible results are obtained from the Rosetta compendium of expression profiles which extend previously published cluster analyses of this data.},

  abstract = {One of the core problems of modern statistics is to approximate difficult-to-compute probability densities. This problem is especially important in Bayesian statistics, which frames all inference about unknown quantities as a calculation involving the posterior density. In this article, we review variational inference (VI), a method from machine learning that approximates probability densities through optimization. VI has been used in many applications and tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind VI is to first posit a family of densities and then to find a member of that family which is close to the target density. Closeness is measured by Kullback\textendash{}Leibler divergence. We review the ideas behind mean-field variational inference, discuss the special case of VI applied to exponential family models, present a full example with a Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to scale up to massive data. We discuss modern research in VI and highlight important open problems. VI is powerful, but it is not yet well understood. Our hope in writing this article is to catalyze statistical research on this class of algorithms. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

Based on the metaphor of statistically derived ``factors'' as representing biological ``subpathway'' structure, we explore the decomposition of fitted sparse factor models into pathway subcomponents and investigate how these components overlay multiple aspects of known biological activity. Our methodology is based on sparsity modeling of multivariate regression, ANOVA, and latent factor models, as well as a class of models that combines all components. Hierarchical sparsity priors address questions of dimension reduction and multiple comparisons, as well as scalability of the methodology. The models include practically relevant non-Gaussian/nonparametric components for latent structure, underlying often quite complex non-Gaussianity in multivariate expression patterns. Model search and fitting are addressed through stochastic simulation and evolutionary stochastic search methods that are exemplified in the oncogenic pathway studies.

  abstract = {Motivation: Comprehensive catalogue of genes that drive tumor initiation and progression in cancer is key to advancing diagnostics, therapeutics and treatment. Given the complexity of cancer, the catalogue is far from complete yet. Increasing evidence shows that driver genes exhibit consistent aberration patterns across multiple-omics in tumors. In this study, we aim to leverage complementary information encoded in each of the omics data to identify novel driver genes through an integrative framework. Specifically, we integrated mutations, gene expression, DNA copy numbers, DNA methylation and protein abundance, all available in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and developed iDriver, a non-parametric Bayesian framework based on multivariate statistical modeling to identify driver genes in an unsupervised fashion. iDriver captures the inherent clusters of gene aberrations and constructs the background distribution that is used to assess and calibrate the confidence of driver genes identified through multi-dimensional genomic data.
Results: We applied the method to 4 cancer types in TCGA and identified candidate driver genes that are highly enriched with known drivers. (e.g.: P {$<$}\,3.40\,\texttimes\,10 -36 for breast cancer). We are particularly interested in novel genes and observed multiple lines of supporting evidence. Using systematic evaluation from multiple independent aspects, we identified 45 candidate driver genes that were not previously known across these 4 cancer types. The finding has important implications that integrating additional genomic data with multivariate statistics can help identify cancer drivers and guide the next stage of cancer genomics research.

The posterior similarity matrix is related to a commonly used loss function by Binder (1978). Minimization of the loss is shown to be equivalent to maximizing the Rand index between estimated and true clustering. We propose new criteria for estimating a clustering, which are based on the posterior expected adjusted Rand index. The criteria are shown to possess a shrinkage property and outperform Binder's loss in a simulation study and in an application to gene expression data.

We introduce a Bayesian method called SUBSTRA that uses regularized biclustering to identify patient subtypes and interpretable subtype-specific transcript clusters. The method iteratively re-weights feature importance to optimize phenotype prediction performance by producing more phenotype-relevant patient subtypes. We investigate the performance of SUBSTRA in finding relevant features using simulated data and successfully benchmark it against state-of-the-art unsupervised stratification methods and supervised alternatives. Moreover, SUBSTRA achieves predictive performance competitive with supervised benchmark methods and provides interpretable transcriptional features in diverse biological settings, such as drug response prediction, cancer diagnosis, or kidney transplant rejection.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  title = {Chromosome Instability Accounts for Reverse Metastatic Outcomes of Pediatric and Adult Synovial Sarcomas},
  volume = {31},
  issn = {1527-7755},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: Synovial sarcoma (SS) occurs in both children and adults, although metastatic events are much more common in adults. Whereas the importance of the t(X;18) translocation in SS oncogenesis is well established, the genetic basis of SS metastasis is still poorly understood. We recently reported expression (CINSARC; Complexity Index in Sarcoma) and Genomic Index prognostic signatures related to chromosome integrity in sarcomas and GI stromal tumors. Here we investigate whether these signatures can also predict outcomes in SS.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred patients who had primary untreated SS tumors were selected for expression and genomic profiling in a training/validation approach.
RESULTS: CINSARC and Genomic Index have strong independent and validated prognostic values (P {$<$} .001). By comparing expression profiles of tumors with or without metastasis, 14 genes that are common to the CINSARC signature were identified, and the two top-ranked genes, KIF14 and CDCA2, were validated as prognostic markers in an independent cohort. Comparing genomic profiles of adult versus pediatric SS, we show that metastasis is associated with genome complexity in both situations and that the adult genome is more frequently rearranged. Accordingly, pediatric patients with an even genomic profile do not develop metastasis.
CONCLUSION: Metastasis development in SS is strongly associated with chromosome complexity, and CINSARC and Genomic Index are validated independent prognostic factors. The differences in metastasis frequency between adults and children are associated with genome instability, which is much more frequent in adults. Genomic Index is potentially the best overall biomarker and clearly the most clinically relevant, considering that genome profiling from formalin-fixed samples is already used in pathology.},

This is because BNP models can accurately approximate any distribution or function and can accommodate a broad range of statistical problems, including density estimation, regression, survival analysis, graphical modeling, neural networks, classification, clustering, population models, forecasting and prediction, spatiotemporal models, and causal inference. This paper describes 3 illustrative applications of BNP methods, including a randomized clinical trial to compare treatments for intraoperative air leaks after pulmonary resection, estimating survival time with different multi-stage chemotherapy regimes for acute leukemia, and evaluating joint effects of targeted treatment and an intermediate biological outcome on progression-free survival time in prostate cancer.},

Recently, several parametric/regression models have been developed utilizing the gene network information to select genes or pathways strongly associated with a clinical/biological outcome. Alternatively, in this paper, we propose a nonparametric Bayesian model for gene selection incorporating network information. In addition to identifying genes that have a strong association with a clinical outcome, our model can select genes with particular expressional behavior, in which case the regression models are not directly applicable. We show that our proposed model is equivalent to an infinity mixture model for which we develop a posterior computation algorithm based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We also propose two fast computing algorithms that approximate the posterior simulation with good accuracy but relatively low computational cost. We illustrate our methods on simulation studies and the analysis of Spellman yeast cell cycle microarray data.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION
Network marker selection on genome-scale networks plays an important role in the understanding of biological mechanisms and disease pathologies. Recently, a Bayesian nonparametric mixture model has been developed and successfully applied for selecting genes and gene sub-networks. Hence, extending this method to a unified approach for network-based feature selection on general large-scale networks and creating an easy-to-use software package is on demand.

RESULTS
We extended the method and developed an R package, the Bayesian network feature finder (BANFF), providing a package of posterior inference, model comparison and graphical illustration of model fitting. The model was extended to a more general form, and a parallel computing algorithm for the Markov chain Monte Carlo -based posterior inference and an expectation maximization-based algorithm for posterior approximation were added. Based on simulation studies, we demonstrate the use of BANFF on analyzing gene expression on a protein-protein interaction network.

Because of technical limitations in current collection and recording methods, most gene expression measurements are carried out on populations of cells and therefore reflect average mRNA levels. The variability of the transcript levels between different cells remains undefined, although it may have profound effects on cellular activities. Here we have measured gene expression levels of the five genes ActB, Ins1, Ins2, Abcc8, and Kcnj11 in individual cells from mouse pancreatic islets. Whereas Ins1 and Ins2 expression show a strong cell\textendash{}cell correlation, this is not the case for the other genes. We further found that the transcript levels of the different genes are lognormally distributed. Hence, the geometric mean of expression levels provides a better estimate of gene activity of the typical cell than does the arithmetic mean measured on a cell population.},

The standard model to describe this variation centres on a gamma distribution driven by stochastic bursts of translation. Stochastic bursting, however, cannot account for the well-established behaviour of strong transcriptional repressors. Instead, it can be shown that the very complexity of the biochemical processes involved in gene expression drives an emergent log-normal distribution of expression levels. Emergent log-normal distributions can account for the observed behaviour of transcriptional repressors, are still compatible with stochastically constrained distributions, and have important implications for both analysis of gene expression data and the engineering of biological organisms.},

We have used RNA-sequencing analysis and linear mixed models to examine the sources of gene expression variability in 317 human iPSC lines from 101 individuals. We found that \$50\% of genome-wide expression variability is explained by variation across individuals and identified a set of expression quantitative trait loci that contribute to this variation. These analyses coupled with allele-specific expression show that iPSCs retain a donor-specific gene expression pattern. Network, pathway, and key driver analyses showed that Polycomb targets contribute significantly to the non-genetic variability seen within and across individuals, highlighting this chromatin regulator as a likely source of reprogramming-based variability. Our findings therefore shed light on variation between iPSC lines and illustrate the potential for our dataset and other similar large-scale analyses to identify underlying drivers relevant to iPSC applications.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Cancer is caused by a diverse array of somatic and germline genomic aberrations. Advances in genomic sequencing technologies have improved the ability to detect these molecular aberrations with greater sensitivity. However, integrating them into clinical management in an individualized manner has proven challenging.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of integrative clinical sequencing and genetic counseling in the assessment and treatment of children and young adults with cancer.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Single-site, observational, consecutive case series (May 2012-October 2014) involving 102 children and young adults (mean age, 10.6 years; median age, 11.5 years, range, 0-22 years) with relapsed, refractory, or rare cancer.
EXPOSURES: Participants underwent integrative clinical exome (tumor and germline DNA) and transcriptome (tumor RNA) sequencing and genetic counseling. Results were discussed by a precision medicine tumor board, which made recommendations to families and their physicians.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Proportion of patients with potentially actionable findings, results of clinical actions based on integrative clinical sequencing, and estimated proportion of patients or their families at risk of future cancer.
RESULTS: Of the 104 screened patients, 102 enrolled with 91 (89\%) having adequate tumor tissue to complete sequencing. Only the 91 patients were included in all calculations, including 28 (31\%) with hematological malignancies and 63 (69\%) with solid tumors. Forty-two patients (46\%) had actionable findings that changed their cancer management: 15 of 28 (54\%) with hematological malignancies and 27 of 63 (43\%) with solid tumors. Individualized actions were taken in 23 of the 91 (25\%) based on actionable integrative clinical sequencing findings, including change in treatment for 14 patients (15\%) and genetic counseling for future risk for 9 patients (10\%). Nine of 91 (10\%) of the personalized clinical interventions resulted in ongoing partial clinical remission of 8 to 16 months or helped sustain complete clinical remission of 6 to 21 months. All 9 patients and families with actionable incidental genetic findings agreed to genetic counseling and screening.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this single-center case series involving young patients with relapsed or refractory cancer, incorporation of integrative clinical sequencing data into clinical management was feasible, revealed potentially actionable findings in 46\% of patients, and was associated with change in treatment and family genetic counseling for a small proportion of patients. The lack of a control group limited assessing whether better clinical outcomes resulted from this approach than outcomes that would have occurred with standard care.},

In a pilot phase, reported here, we developed the logistical and analytical pipelines necessary for rapid and comprehensive molecular profiling in a clinical setting. Fifty-seven patients from 20 centers were prospectively recruited. Malignancies investigated included sarcomas (n~=~25), brain tumours (n~=~23), and others (n~=~9). Whole-exome, low-coverage whole-genome, and RNA sequencing were complemented with methylation and expression microarray analyses. Alterations were assessed for potential targetability according to a customised prioritisation algorithm and subsequently discussed in an interdisciplinary molecular tumour board. Next-generation sequencing data were generated for 52 patients, with the full analysis possible in 46 of 52. Turnaround time from sample receipt until first report averaged 28~d. Twenty-six patients (50\%) harbored a potentially druggable alteration with a prioritisation score of `intermediate' or higher (level 4 of 7). Common targets included receptor tyrosine kinases, phosphoinositide 3-kinase\textendash{}mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, and cell cycle control. Ten patients received a targeted therapy based on these findings, with responses observed in some previously treatment-refractory tumours. Comparative primary relapse analysis revealed substantial tumour evolution as well as one case of unsuspected secondary malignancy, highlighting the importance of re-biopsy at relapse. This study demonstrates the feasibility of comprehensive, real-time molecular profiling for high-risk paediatric cancer patients. This extended proof-of-concept, with examples of treatment consequences, expands upon previous personalised oncology endeavors, and presents a model with considerable interest and practical relevance in the burgeoning era of personalised medicine.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Molecular characterization has the potential to advance the management of pediatric cancer and high-risk hematologic disease. The clinical integration of genome sequencing into standard clinical practice has been limited and the potential utility of genome sequencing to identify clinically impactful information beyond targetable alterations has been underestimated.
METHODS: The Precision in Pediatric Sequencing (PIPseq) Program at Columbia University Medical Center instituted prospective clinical next generation sequencing (NGS) for pediatric cancer and hematologic disorders at risk for treatment failure. We performed cancer whole exome sequencing (WES) of patient-matched tumor-normal samples and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of tumor to identify sequence variants, fusion transcripts, relative gene expression, and copy number variation (CNV). A directed cancer gene panel assay was used when sample adequacy was a concern. Constitutional WES of patients and parents was performed when a constitutionally encoded disease was suspected. Results were initially reviewed by a molecular pathologist and subsequently by a multi-disciplinary molecular tumor board. Clinical reports were issued to the ordering physician and posted to the patient's electronic medical record.
RESULTS: NGS was performed on tumor and/or normal tissue from 101 high-risk pediatric patients. Potentially actionable alterations were identified in 38\% of patients, of which only 16\% subsequently received matched therapy. In an additional 38\% of patients, the genomic data provided clinically relevant information of diagnostic, prognostic, or pharmacogenomic significance. RNA-seq was clinically impactful in 37/65 patients (57\%) providing diagnostic and/or prognostic information for 17 patients (26\%) and identified therapeutic targets in 15 patients (23\%). Known or likely pathogenic germline alterations were discovered in 18/90 patients (20\%) with 14\% having germline alternations in cancer predisposition genes. American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) secondary findings were identified in six patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of incorporating clinical NGS into pediatric hematology-oncology practice. Beyond the identification of actionable alterations, the ability to avoid ineffective/inappropriate therapies, make a definitive diagnosis, and identify pharmacogenomic modifiers is clinically impactful. Taking a more inclusive view of potential clinical utility, 66\% of cases tested through our program had clinically impactful findings and samples interrogated with both WES and RNA-seq resulted in data that impacted clinical decisions in 75\% of cases.},

  abstract = {The proto-oncogene KRAS is mutated in a wide array of human cancers, most of which are aggressive and respond poorly to standard therapies. Although the identification of specific oncogenes has led to the development of clinically effective, molecularly targeted therapies in some cases, KRAS has remained refractory to this approach. A complementary strategy for targeting KRAS is to identify gene products that, when inhibited, result in cell death only in the presence of an oncogenic allele,. Here we have used systematic RNA interference (RNAi) to detect synthetic lethal partners of oncogenic KRAS and found that the non-canonical I{$\kappa$}B kinase, TBK1, was selectively essential in cells that harbor mutant KRAS. Suppression of TBK1 induced apoptosis specifically in human cancer cell lines that depend on oncogenic KRAS expression. In these cells, TBK1 activated NF-{$\kappa$}B anti-apoptotic signals involving cREL and BCL-XL that were essential for survival, providing mechanistic insights into this synthetic lethal interaction. These observations identify TBK1 and NF-{$\kappa$}B signaling as essential in KRAS mutant tumors and establish a general approach for the rational identification of co-dependent pathways in cancer.},

  abstract = {Three important areas of data analysis for global gene expression analysis are class discovery, class prediction, and finding dysregulated genes (biomarkers). The clinical application of microarray data will require marker genes whose expression patterns are sufficiently well understood to allow accurate predictions on disease subclass membership. Commonly used methods of analysis include hierarchical clustering algorithms, t-, F-, and Z-tests, and machine learning approaches. We describe an approach called the maximum difference subset (MDSS) algorithm that combines classification algorithms, classical statistics, and elements of machine learning and provides a coherent framework. By integrating prediction accuracy, the MDSS algorithm learns the critical threshold of statistical significance (the {$\alpha$} or P-value), eliminating the arbitrariness of setting a threshold of statistical significance and minimizing the effect of the normality assumptions. To reduce the false positive rate and to increase external validity of the predictive gene set, a jackknife step is used. This step identifies and removes genes in the initial MDSS with low combined predictive utility. The overall MDSS provides a prediction that is less dependent on an arbitrary study design (sample inclusion or exclusion) and should thus have high external validity. We demonstrate that this approach, unlike other published methods, identifies biomarkers capable of predicting the outcome of anthracycline-cytarabine chemotherapy in cases of acute myeloid leukemia. By incorporating two criteria\textemdash{}statistical significance and predictive utility\textemdash{}the approach learns the significance level relevant for a given data set. The MDSS approach can be used with any test and classifier operator pair.},

Clustering is an unsupervised learning method, grouping data points based on similarity, with the goal of revealing the underlying structure of data. Advances in molecular biology have yielded large and complex data sets, making clustering essential to understand and visualize the data. Clustering can be a powerful technique, but it harbors potential pitfalls due to the high-dimensional nature of biological data, the failure to consider more than one clustering method for a given problem, and the difficulty in determining whether clustering has produced meaningful results. We present concrete examples of problems and solutions (clustering results) in the form of toy problems and real biological data for these pitfalls, illustrating how to avoid overinterpreting the data and missing valuable insights within high-throughput molecular measurements. The article contains six figures, four tables, and 77 references.
Clustering is an unsupervised learning method, which groups data points based on similarity, and is used to reveal the underlying structure of data. This computational approach is essential to understanding and visualizing the complex data that are acquired in high-throughput multidimensional biological experiments. Clustering enables researchers to make biological inferences for further experiments. Although a powerful technique, inappropriate application can lead biological researchers to waste resources and time in experimental follow-up. We review common pitfalls identified from the published molecular biology literature and present methods to avoid them. Commonly encountered pitfalls relate to the high-dimensional nature of biological data from high-throughput experiments, the failure to consider more than one clustering method for a given problem, and the difficulty in determining whether clustering has produced meaningful results. We present concrete examples of problems and solutions (clustering results) in the form of toy problems and real biological data for these issues. We also discuss ensemble clustering as an easy-to-implement method that enables the exploration of multiple clustering solutions and improves robustness of clustering solutions. Increased awareness of common clustering pitfalls will help researchers avoid overinterpreting or misinterpreting the results and missing valuable insights when clustering biological data.
Properly applied, clustering methods reveal meaning in high-throughput biological data.

In parallel, the number of companies centered on applying complex data analysis to varying industries has exploded, and it is thus unsurprising that some analytic companies are turning attention to problems in healthcare. The purpose of this review is to explore what problems in medicine might benefit from such learning approaches and use examples from the literature to introduce basic concepts in machine learning. It is important to note that seemingly large enough medical data sets and adequate learning algorithms have been available for many decades \textendash{} and yet, although there are thousands of papers applying machine learning algorithms to medical data, very few have contributed meaningfully to clinical care. This lack of impact stands in stark contrast to the enormous relevance of machine learning to many other industries. Thus part of my effort will be to identify what obstacles there may be to changing the practice of medicine through statistical learning approaches, and discuss how these might be overcome.},

Furthermore, it can handle data with arbitrarily high fragment mass accuracy, is able to assign and score complex patterns of post-translational modifications, such as highly phosphorylated peptides, and accommodates extremely large databases. The algorithms of Andromeda are provided. Andromeda can function independently or as an integrated search engine of the widely used MaxQuant computational proteomics platform and both are freely available at www.maxquant.org. The combination enables analysis of large data sets in a simple analysis workflow on a desktop computer. For searching individual spectra Andromeda is also accessible via a web server. We demonstrate the flexibility of the system by implementing the capability to identify cofragmented peptides, significantly improving the total number of identified peptides.},

The computational advantages of our algorithms are demonstrated with various simulated data examples in which we compare our stochastic search with a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm in moderate dimensional data examples. These experiments show that our stochastic search largely outperforms the MCMC algorithm in terms of computing-times and in terms of the quality of the posterior mode discovered. Finally, we analyze a gene expression dataset in which MCMC algorithms are too slow to be practically useful.},

We designed a novel high-throughput, reproducible and sensitive method for sequential immuno-affinity purification of HLA-I and -II peptides from up to 96 samples in a plate format, suitable for both cell lines and tissues. Our methodology drastically reduces sample-handling and can be completed within five hours. We challenged our methodology by extracting HLA peptides from multiple replicates of tissues (n = 7) and cell lines (n = 21, 108 cells per replicate), which resulted in unprecedented depth, sensitivity and high reproducibility (Pearson correlations up to 0.98 and 0.97 for HLA-I and HLA-II). Because of the method's achieved sensitivity, even single measurements of peptides purified from 107 B-cells resulted in the identification of more than 1700 HLA-I and 2200 HLA-II peptides. We demonstrate the feasibility of performing drug-screening by using ovarian cancer cells treated with interferon gamma (IFN{$\gamma$}). Our analysis revealed an augmented presentation of chymotryptic-like and longer ligands associated with IFN{$\gamma$} induced changes of the antigen processing and presentation machinery.

Mass spectrometry enables the direct and unbiased discovery and selection of tumor-specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) peptides that can be used to define targets for immunotherapy. Combining these targets into a warehouse allows for multi-target therapy and accelerated clinical application. For precise personalization aimed at optimally ensuring treatment efficacy and safety, it is necessary to assess the presence of the target on each individual patient's tumor.

The spatial and temporal variations of mRNAs, as well as the local availability of resources for protein biosynthesis, strongly influence the relationship between protein levels and their coding transcripts. We further discuss the buffering of mRNA fluctuations at the level of protein concentrations. We conclude that transcript levels by themselves are not sufficient to predict protein levels in many scenarios and to thus explain genotype-phenotype relationships and that high-quality data quantifying different levels of gene expression are indispensable for the complete understanding of biological processes.},

  title = {Transcriptional Landscape of Repetitive Elements in Normal and Cancer Human Cells},
  volume = {15},
  issn = {1471-2164},
  abstract = {Background
Repetitive elements comprise at least 55\% of the human genome with more recent estimates as high as two-thirds. Most of these elements are retrotransposons, DNA sequences that can insert copies of themselves into new genomic locations by a ``copy and paste'' mechanism. These mobile genetic elements play important roles in shaping genomes during evolution, and have been implicated in the etiology of many human diseases. Despite their abundance and diversity, few studies investigated the regulation of endogenous retrotransposons at the genome-wide scale, primarily because of the technical difficulties of uniquely mapping high-throughput sequencing reads to repetitive DNA.

Results
Here we develop a new computational method called RepEnrich to study genome-wide transcriptional regulation of repetitive elements. We show that many of the Long Terminal Repeat retrotransposons in humans are transcriptionally active in a cell line-specific manner. Cancer cell lines display increased RNA Polymerase II binding to retrotransposons than cell lines derived from normal tissue. Consistent with increased transcriptional activity of retrotransposons in cancer cells we found significantly higher levels of L1 retrotransposon RNA expression in prostate tumors compared to normal-matched controls.

Conclusions
Our results support increased transcription of retrotransposons in transformed cells, which may explain the somatic retrotransposition events recently reported in several types of cancers.

  abstract = {Human organogenesis is when severe developmental abnormalities commonly originate. However, understanding this critical embryonic phase has relied upon inference from patient phenotypes and assumptions from in vitro stem cell models and non-human vertebrates. We report an integrated transcriptomic atlas of human organogenesis. By lineage-guided principal components analysis, we uncover novel relatedness of particular developmental genes across different organs and tissues and identified unique transcriptional codes which correctly predicted the cause of many congenital disorders. By inference, our model pinpoints co-enriched genes as new causes of developmental disorders such as cleft palate and congenital heart disease. The data revealed more than 6000 novel transcripts, over 90\% of which fulfil criteria as long non-coding RNAs correlated with the protein-coding genome over megabase distances. Taken together, we have uncovered cryptic transcriptional programs used by the human embryo and established a new resource for the molecular understanding of human organogenesis and its associated disorders.},

  abstract = {AbstractRecent elucidation of the role of central tolerance in preventing organ-specific autoimmunity has changed our concepts of self/nonself discrimination. This paradigmatic shift is largely attributable to the discovery of promiscuous expression of tissue-restricted self-antigens (TRAs) by medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs). TRA expression in mTECs mirrors virtually all tissues of the body, irrespective of developmental or spatio-temporal expression patterns. This review summarizes current knowledge on the cellular and molecular regulation of TRA expression in mTECs, outlines relevant mechanisms of antigen presentation and modes of tolerance induction, and discusses implications for the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases and other biological processes such as fertility, pregnancy, puberty, and tumor defense.},

  abstract = {The crucial capability of T cells for discrimination between self and non-self peptides is based on negative selection of developing thymocytes by medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs). The mTECs purge autoreactive T cells by expression of cell-type specific genes referred to as tissue-restricted antigens (TRAs). Although the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) protein is known to promote the expression of a subset of TRAs, its mechanism of action is still not fully understood. The expression of TRAs that are not under the control of AIRE also needs further characterization. Furthermore, expression patterns of TRA genes have been suggested to change over the course of mTEC development. Herein we have used single-cell RNA-sequencing to resolve patterns of TRA expression during mTEC development. Our data indicated that mTEC development consists of three distinct stages, correlating with previously described jTEC, mTEChi and mTEClo phenotypes. For each subpopulation, we have identified marker genes useful in future studies. Aire-induced TRAs were switched on during jTEC-mTEC transition and were expressed in genomic clusters, while otherwise the subsets expressed largely overlapping sets of TRAs. Moreover, population-level analysis of TRA expression frequencies suggested that such differences might not be necessary to achieve efficient thymocyte selection.},

Here, we addressed whether analyses of tumour mRNA at the exon level can improve on the predictive power and classification accuracy of gene-based expression profiles using neuroblastoma as a model. METHODS In a patient cohort comprising 113 primary neuroblastoma specimens expression profiling using exon-level analyses was performed to define predictive signatures using various machine-learning techniques. Alternative transcript use was calculated from relative exon expression. Validation of alternative transcripts was achieved using qPCR- and cell-based approaches. RESULTS Both predictors derived from the gene or the exon levels resulted in prediction accuracies {$>$}80{{\%}} for both event-free and overall survival and proved as independent prognostic markers in multivariate analyses. Alternative transcript use was most prominently linked to the amplification status of the MYCN oncogene, expression of the TrkA/NTRK1 neurotrophin receptor and survival. CONCLUSION As exon level-based prediction yields comparable, but not significantly better, prediction accuracy than gene expression-based predictors, gene-based assays seem to be sufficiently precise for predicting outcome of neuroblastoma patients. However, exon-level analyses provide added knowledge by identifying alternative transcript use, which should deepen the understanding of neuroblastoma biology.},

  abstract = {Hepatoblastomas are uncommon embryonal liver tumors accounting for approximately 80{{\%}} of childhood hepatic cancer. We hypothesized that epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation, could be relevant to hepatoblastoma onset. The methylomes of eight matched hepatoblastomas and non-tumoral liver tissues were characterized, and data were validated in an independent group (11 hepatoblastomas). In comparison to differentiated livers, hepatoblastomas exhibited a widespread and non-stochastic pattern of global low-level hypomethylation. The analysis revealed 1,359 differentially methylated CpG sites (DMSs) between hepatoblastomas and control livers, which are associated with 765 genes. Hypomethylation was detected in hepatoblastomas for {{\~}}58{{\%}} of the DMSs with enrichment at intergenic sites, and most of the hypermethylated CpGs were located in CpG islands. Functional analyses revealed enrichment in signaling pathways involved in metabolism, negative regulation of cell differentiation, liver development, cancer, and Wnt signaling pathway. Strikingly, an important overlap was observed between the 1,359 DMSs and the CpG sites reported to exhibit methylation changes through liver development (p{$<$}0.0001), with similar patterns of methylation in both hepatoblastomas and fetal livers compared to adult livers. Overall, our results suggest an arrest at early stages of liver cell differentiation, in line with the hypothesis that hepatoblastoma ontogeny involves the disruption of liver development. This genome-wide methylation dysfunction, taken together with a relatively small number of driver genetic mutations reported for both adult and pediatric liver cancers, shed light on the relevance of epigenetic mechanisms for hepatic tumorigenesis.},

Ancient repeats have been continuously classified as TEs by finding similar TEs from other organisms. Here, the most comprehensive picture of human repeat sequences is presented. The human genome contains traces of 10 clades (L1, CR1, L2, Crack, RTE, RTEX, R4, Vingi, Tx1 and Penelope) of non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons (long interspersed elements, LINEs), 3 types (SINE1/7SL, SINE2/tRNA, and SINE3/5S) of short interspersed elements (SINEs), 1 composite retrotransposon (SVA) family, 5 classes (ERV1, ERV2, ERV3, Gypsy and DIRS) of LTR retrotransposons, and 12 superfamilies (Crypton, Ginger1, Harbinger, hAT, Helitron, Kolobok, Mariner, Merlin, MuDR, P, piggyBac and Transib) of DNA transposons. These TE footprints demonstrate an evolutionary continuum of the human genome.},

  abstract = {Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by epidermal hyperproliferation and altered keratinocyte differentiation and inflammation and is caused by the interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Previous studies have revealed that DNA methylation (DNAm) and genetic makers are closely associated with psoriasis, and strong evidences have shown that DNAm can be controlled by genetic factors, which attracted us to evaluate the relationship among DNAm, genetic makers, and disease status. We utilized the genome-wide methylation data of psoriatic skin (PP, N = 114) and unaffected control skin (NN, N = 62) tissue samples in our previous study, and we performed whole-genome genotyping with peripheral blood of the same samples to evaluate the underlying genetic effect on skin DNA methylation. Causal inference test (CIT) was used to assess whether DNAm regulate genetic variation and gain a better understanding of the epigenetic basis of psoriasis susceptibility. We identified 129 SNP-CpG pairs achieving the significant association threshold, which constituted 28 unique methylation quantitative trait loci (MethQTL) and 34 unique CpGs. There are 18 SNPs were associated with psoriasis at a Bonferoni-corrected P {$<$} 0.05, and these 18 SNPs formed 93 SNP-CpG pairs with 17 unique CpG sites. We found that 11 of 93 SNP-CpG pairs, composed of 5 unique SNPs and 3 CpG sites, presented a methylation-mediated relationship between SNPs and psoriasis. The 3 CpG sites were located on the body of C1orf106, the TSS1500 promoter region of DMBX1 and the body of SIK3. This study revealed that DNAm of some genes can be controlled by genetic factors and also mediate risk variation for psoriasis in Chinese Han population and provided novel molecular insights into the pathogenesis of psoriasis.},

  abstract = {Aberrant activation of innate immune receptors can cause a spectrum of immune disorders, such as Aicardi-Gouti{\`e}res syndrome (AGS). One such receptor is MDA5, a viral dsRNA sensor that induces antiviral immune response. Using a newly developed RNase-protection/RNA-seq approach, we demonstrate here that constitutive activation of MDA5 in AGS results from the loss of tolerance to cellular dsRNAs formed by Alu retroelements. While wild-type MDA5 cannot efficiently recognize Alu-dsRNAs because of its limited filament formation on imperfect duplexes, AGS variants of MDA5 display reduced sensitivity to duplex structural irregularities, assembling signaling-competent filaments on Alu-dsRNAs. Moreover, we identified an unexpected role of an RNA-rich cellular environment in suppressing aberrant MDA5 oligomerization, highlighting context dependence of self versus non-self discrimination. Overall, our work demonstrates that the increased efficiency of MDA5 in recognizing dsRNA comes at a cost of self-recognition and implicates a unique role of Alu-dsRNAs as virus-like elements that shape the primate immune system.},

A number of methods, based on general dimensionality reduction techniques, have been suggested to help infer and visualise the underlying structure of cell populations from single-cell expression levels, yet their models generally lack proper biological grounding and struggle at identifying complex differentiation paths. Here we introduce cellTree: an R/Bioconductor package that uses a novel statistical approach, based on document analysis techniques, to produce tree structures outlining the hierarchical relationship between single-cell samples, while identifying latent groups of genes that can provide biological insights. With cellTree, we provide experimentalists with an easy-to-use tool, based on statistically and biologically-sound algorithms, to efficiently explore and visualise single-cell RNA data.

  abstract = {Gene expression profiling is being widely applied in cancer research to identify biomarkers for clinical endpoint prediction. Since RNA-seq provides a powerful tool for transcriptome-based applications beyond the limitations of microarrays, we sought to systematically evaluate the performance of RNA-seq-based and microarray-based classifiers in this MAQC-III/SEQC study for clinical endpoint prediction using neuroblastoma as a model. We generate gene expression profiles from 498 primary neuroblastomas using both RNA-seq and 44 k microarrays. Characterization of the neuroblastoma transcriptome by RNA-seq reveals that more than 48,000 genes and 200,000 transcripts are being expressed in this malignancy. We also find that RNA-seq provides much more detailed information on specific transcript expression patterns in clinico-genetic neuroblastoma subgroups than microarrays. To systematically compare the power of RNA-seq and microarray-based models in predicting clinical endpoints, we divide the cohort randomly into training and validation sets and develop 360 predictive models on six clinical endpoints of varying predictability. Evaluation of factors potentially affecting model performances reveals that prediction accuracies are most strongly influenced by the nature of the clinical endpoint, whereas technological platforms (RNA-seq vs. microarrays), RNA-seq data analysis pipelines, and feature levels (gene vs. transcript vs. exon-junction level) do not significantly affect performances of the models. We demonstrate that RNA-seq outperforms microarrays in determining the transcriptomic characteristics of cancer, while RNA-seq and microarray-based models perform similarly in clinical endpoint prediction. Our findings may be valuable to guide future studies on the development of gene expression-based predictive models and their implementation in clinical practice.},

Although sequencing costs are rapidly decreasing, almost 70{{\%}} of all the human RNA-seq samples in the gene expression omnibus do not have biological replicates and more unreplicated RNA-seq data were published than replicated RNA-seq data in 2011. Despite the large amount of single replicate studies, there is currently no satisfactory method for detecting differentially expressed genes when only a single biological replicate is available. RESULTS We present the GFOLD (generalized fold change) algorithm to produce biologically meaningful rankings of differentially expressed genes from RNA-seq data. GFOLD assigns reliable statistics for expression changes based on the posterior distribution of log fold change. In this way, GFOLD overcomes the shortcomings of P-value and fold change calculated by existing RNA-seq analysis methods and gives more stable and biological meaningful gene rankings when only a single biological replicate is available.

  abstract = {Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) and the widely applicable information criterion (WAIC) are methods for estimating pointwise out-of-sample prediction accuracy from a fitted Bayesian model using the log-likelihood evaluated at the posterior simulations of the parameter values. LOO and WAIC have various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive error such as AIC and DIC but are less used in practice because they involve additional computational steps. Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparing of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called loo and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

  abstract = {The genome-wide identification of pairs of interacting proteins is an important step in the elucidation of cell regulatory mechanisms. Much of our present knowledge derives from high-throughput techniques such as the yeast two-hybrid assay and affinity purification, as well as from manual curation of experiments on individual systems. A variety of computational approaches based, for example, on sequence homology, gene co-expression and phylogenetic profiles, have also been developed for the genome-wide inference of protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Yet comparative studies suggest that the development of accurate and complete repertoires of PPIs is still in its early stages. Here we show that three-dimensional structural information can be used to predict PPIs with an accuracy and coverage that are superior to predictions based on non-structural evidence. Moreover, an algorithm, termed PrePPI, which combines structural information with other functional clues, is comparable in accuracy to high-throughput experiments, yielding over 30,000 high-confidence interactions for yeast and over 300,000 for human. Experimental tests of a number of predictions demonstrate the ability of the PrePPI algorithm to identify unexpected PPIs of considerable biological interest. The surprising effectiveness of three-dimensional structural information can be attributed to the use of homology models combined with the exploitation of both close and remote geometric relationships between proteins.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Whole-genome high-coverage sequencing has been widely used for personal and cancer genomics as well as in various research areas. However, in the lack of an unbiased whole-genome truth set, the global error rate of variant calls and the leading causal artifacts still remain unclear even given the great efforts in the evaluation of variant calling methods. Results: We made ten SNP and INDEL call sets with two read mappers and five variant callers, both on a haploid human genome and a diploid genome at a similar coverage. By investigating false heterozygous calls in the haploid genome, we identified the erroneous realignment in low-complexity regions and the incomplete reference genome with respect to the sample as the two major sources of errors, which press for continued improvements in these two areas. We estimated that the error rate of raw genotype calls is as high as 1 in 10-15kb, but the error rate of post-filtered calls is reduced to 1 in 100-200kb without significant compromise on the sensitivity.

  volume = {56},
  issn = {10452257},
  abstract = {Amplification of the MYCN gene in neuroblastoma is associated with a poor prognosis and is considered to remain unchanged in post-treatment specimens and metastases. While heterogeneity of MYCN copy number in tumor cells has been reported, serial samples have only been studied in a limited way, and the biologic relevance of this finding is not well understood. We used in situ hybridization on paraffin sections of 102 specimens from 30 patients with MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma to determine MYCN copy number in the primary tumor, pre- and post-treatment, and in metastatic samples. Nineteen cases (63{{\%}}) showed diffuse MYCN amplification in all samples tested. Nine cases (30{{\%}}) showed a reduction in MYCN copy number: five cases with diffuse amplification subsequently showed focal amplification, one case with diffuse MYCN amplification showed MYCN gain after treatment, and three focally amplified cases were non-amplified in later specimens. In two cases (7{{\%}}), focal amplification became diffuse in subsequent samples. Histology was not predictive of the temporal or spatial pattern of MYCN amplification for a particular tumor. If extent of amplification (focal vs. diffuse) is not considered, 26/30 (87{{\%}}) of cases were consistently MYCN-amplified. However, our data suggest that MYCN status can be heterogeneous between tumor sites, during tumor progression or following treatment, challenging the notion that MYCN copy number does not change for a particular neuroblastoma. Assessing the biologic significance of MYCN heterogeneity will require larger studies of clinically annotated tumor samples, and will depend on interpreting heterogeneity in MYCN status in combination with other genetic changes. \textcopyright{} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Malignant cells within the same tumor displayed transcriptional heterogeneity associated with the cell cycle, spatial context, and a drug-resistance program. In particular, all tumors harbored malignant cells from two distinct transcriptional cell states, such that tumors characterized by high levels of the MITF transcription factor also contained cells with low MITF and elevated levels of the AXL kinase. Single-cell analyses suggested distinct tumor microenvironmental patterns, including cell-to-cell interactions. Analysis of tumor-infiltrating T cells revealed exhaustion programs, their connection to T cell activation and clonal expansion, and their variability across patients. Overall, we begin to unravel the cellular ecosystem of tumors and how single-cell genomics offers insights with implications for both targeted and immune therapies.},

  abstract = {The genetic dependencies of human cancers widely vary. Here, we catalog this heterogeneity and use it to identify functional gene interactions and genotype-dependent liabilities in cancer. By using genome-wide CRISPR-based screens, we generate a gene essentiality dataset across 14 human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines. Sets of genes with correlated patterns of essentiality across the lines reveal new gene relationships, the essential substrates of enzymes, and the molecular functions of uncharacterized proteins. Comparisons of differentially essential genes between Ras-dependent and -independent lines uncover synthetic lethal partners of oncogenic Ras. Screens in both human AML and engineered mouse pro-B cells converge on a surprisingly small number of genes in the Ras processing and MAPK pathways and pinpoint PREX1 as an AML-specific activator of MAPK signaling. Our findings suggest general strategies for defining mammalian gene networks and synthetic lethal interactions by exploiting the natural genetic and epigenetic diversity of human cancer cells.},

  title = {Hierarchical {{Dirichlet Processes}}},
  abstract = {We consider problems involving groups of data, where each observation within a group is a draw from a mixture model, and where it is desirable to share mixture components between groups. We assume that the number of mixture components is unknown a priori and is to be inferred from the data. In this setting it is natural to consider sets of Dirichlet processes, one for each group, where the well-known clustering property of the Dirichlet process provides a nonparametric prior for the number of mixture components within each group. Given our desire to tie the mixture models in the various groups, we consider a hierarchical model, specifically one in which the base measure for the child Dirichlet processes is itself distributed according to a Dirichlet process. Such a base measure being discrete, the child Dirichlet processes necessar-ily share atoms. Thus, as desired, the mixture models in the different groups necessarily share mixture components. We discuss representations of hierarchical Dirichlet processes in terms of a stick-breaking process, and a generalization of the Chinese restaurant process that we refer to as the " Chinese restaurant franchise. " We present Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for posterior inference in hierarchical Dirichlet process mixtures, and describe applications to problems in information retrieval and text modelling.},

Microarray-based comparative genome hybridization (arrayCGH) or genotyping arrays have been standard technologies to detect large regions subject to copy number changes in genomes until most recently high-resolution sequence data can be analyzed by next-generation sequencing (NGS). During the last several years, NGS-based analysis has been widely applied to identify CNVs in both healthy and diseased individuals. Correspondingly, the strong demand for NGS-based CNV analyses has fuelled development of numerous computational methods and tools for CNV detection. In this article, we review the recent advances in computational methods pertaining to CNV detection using whole genome and whole exome sequencing data. Additionally, we discuss their strengths and weaknesses and suggest directions for future development.},

Brain tumor-derived cell lines are critical for studying the biology of pediatric brain tumors and can be useful for initial screening of new therapies. Use of appropriate brain tumor cell lines for experiments is important, as results may differ depending on tumor properties, and can thus affect the conclusions and applicability of the model. Despite reports in the literature of over 60 pediatric brain tumor cell lines, the majority of published papers utilize only a small number of these cell lines. Here we list the approximately 60 currently-published pediatric brain tumor cell lines and summarize some of their central features as a resource for scientists seeking pediatric brain tumor cell lines for their research.},

  volume = {474},
  issn = {0028-0836},
  abstract = {Over the past years, tremendous efforts have been made to elucidate the molecular basis of the initiation and progression of ovarian cancer. However, most existing studies have been focused on individual genes or a single type of data, which may lack the power to detect the complex mechanisms of cancer formation by overlooking the interactions of different genetic and epigenetic factors. We propose an integrative framework to identify genetic and epigenetic features related to ovarian cancer and to quantify the causal relationships among these features using a probabilistic graphical model based on the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. In the feature selection, we first defined a set of seed genes by including 48 candidate tumor suppressors or oncogenes and an additional 20 ovarian cancer related genes reported in the literature. The seed genes were then fed into a stepwise correlation-based selector to identify 271 additional features including 177 genes, 82 copy number variation sites, 11 methylation sites and 1 somatic mutation (at gene TP53). We built a Bayesian network model with a logit link function to quantify the causal relationships among these features and discovered a set of 13 hub genes including ARID1A, C19orf53, CSKN2A1 and COL5A2. The directed graph revealed many potential genetic pathways, some of which confirmed the existing results in the literature. Clustering analysis further suggested four gene clusters, three of which correspond to well-defined cellular processes including cell division, tumor invasion and mitochondrial system. In addition, two genes related to glycoprotein synthesis, PSG11 and GALNT10, were found highly predictive for the overall survival time of ovarian cancer patients. The proposed framework is effective in identifying possible important genetic and epigenetic features that are related to complex cancer diseases. The constructed Bayesian network has identified some new genetic/epigenetic pathways, which may shed new light into the molecular mechanisms of ovarian cancer.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE We looked at the value of three preclinical cancer models, the in vitro human cell line, the human xenograft, and the murine allograft, to examine whether they are reliable in predicting clinical utility. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN Thirty-one cytotoxic cancer drugs were selected. Literature was searched for drug activity in Phase II trials, human xenograft, and mouse allografts in breast, non-small cell lung, ovary, and colon cancers. Data from the National Cancer Institute Human Tumor Cell Line Screen were used to calculate drug in vitro preclinical activity for each cancer type. Phase II activity versus preclinical activity scatter plot and correlation analysis was conducted for each model, by tumor type (disease-oriented approach), using one tumor type as a predictor of overall activity in the other three tumor types combined (compound-oriented approach) and for all four tumor types together. RESULTS The in vitro cell line model was predictive for non-small cell lung cancer under the disease-oriented approach, for breast and ovarian cancers under the compound-oriented approach, and for all four tumor types together. The mouse allograft model was not predictive. The human xenograft model was not predictive for breast or colon cancers, but was predictive for non-small cell lung and ovarian cancers when panels of xenografts were used. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that under the right framework and when panels are used, the in vitro cell line and human xenograft models may be useful in predicting the Phase II clinical trial performance of cancer drugs. Murine allograft models, as used in this analysis, appear of limited utility.},

  volume = {7},
  issn = {14712164},
  abstract = {RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) experiments have been optimized for library preparation, mapping, and gene expression estimation. These methods, however, have revealed weaknesses in the next stages of analysis of differential expression, with results sensitive to systematic sample stratification or, in more extreme cases, to outliers. Further, a method to assess normalization and adjustment measures imposed on the data is lacking. To address these issues, we utilize previously published eQTLs as a novel gold standard at the center of a framework that integrates DNA genotypes and RNA-Seq data to optimize analysis and aid in the understanding of genetic variation and gene expression. After detecting sample contamination and sequencing outliers in RNA-Seq data, a set of previously published brain eQTLs was used to determine if sample outlier removal was appropriate. Improved replication of known eQTLs supported removal of these samples in downstream analyses. eQTL replication was further employed to assess normalization methods, covariate inclusion, and gene annotation. This method was validated in an independent RNA-Seq blood data set from the GTEx project and a tissue-appropriate set of eQTLs. eQTL replication in both data sets highlights the necessity of accounting for unknown covariates in RNA-Seq data analysis. As each RNA-Seq experiment is unique with its own experiment-specific limitations, we offer an easily-implementable method that uses the replication of known eQTLs to guide each step in one's data analysis pipeline. In the two data sets presented herein, we highlight not only the necessity of careful outlier detection but also the need to account for unknown covariates in RNA-Seq experiments.},

  volume = {366},
  issn = {1872-7980},
  abstract = {LIN28B has been identified as an oncogene in various tumor entities, including neuroblastoma, a childhood cancer that originates from neural crest-derived cells, and is characterized by amplification of the MYCN oncogene. Recently, elevated LIN28B expression levels were shown to contribute to neuroblastoma tumorigenesis via let-7 dependent de-repression of MYCN. However, additional insight in the regulation of LIN28B in neuroblastoma is lacking. Therefore, we have performed a comprehensive analysis of the regulation of LIN28B in neuroblastoma, with a specific focus on the contribution of miRNAs. We show that MYCN regulates LIN28B expression in neuroblastoma tumors via two distinct parallel mechanisms. First, through an unbiased LIN28B-3'UTR reporter screen, we found that miR-26a-5p and miR-26b-5p regulate LIN28B expression. Next, we demonstrated that MYCN indirectly affects the expression of miR-26a-5p, and hence regulates LIN28B, therefore establishing an MYCN-miR-26a-5p-LIN28B regulatory axis. Second, we provide evidence that MYCN regulates LIN28B expression via interaction with the LIN28B promoter, establishing a direct MYCN-LIN28B regulatory axis. We believe that these findings mark LIN28B as an important effector of the MYCN oncogenic phenotype and underline the importance of MYCN-regulated miRNAs in establishing the MYCN-driven oncogenic process.},

  abstract = {Single-cell RNA-seq mammalian transcriptome studies are at an early stage in uncovering cell-to-cell variation in gene expression, transcript processing and editing, and regulatory module activity. Despite great progress recently, substantial challenges remain, including discriminating biological variation from technical noise. Here we apply the SMART-seq single-cell RNA-seq protocol to study the reference lymphoblastoid cell line GM12878. By using spike-in quantification standards, we estimate the absolute number of RNA molecules per cell for each gene and find significant variation in total mRNA content: between 50,000 and 300,000 transcripts per cell. We directly measure technical stochasticity by a pool/split design and find that there are significant differences in expression between individual cells, over and above technical variation. Specific gene coexpression modules were preferentially expressed in subsets of individual cells, including one enriched for mRNA processing and splicing factors. We assess cell-to-cell variation in alternative splicing and allelic bias and report evidence of significant differences in splice site usage that exceed splice variation in the pool/split comparison. Finally, we show that transcriptomes from small pools of 30-100 cells approach the information content and reproducibility of contemporary RNA-seq from large amounts of input material. Together, our results define an experimental and computational path forward for analyzing gene expression in rare cell types and cell states.},

  volume = {9},
  issn = {1479-7364},
  abstract = {This review explores the limitations of self-reported race, ethnicity, and genetic ancestry in biomedical research. Various terminologies are used to classify human differences in genomic research including race, ethnicity, and ancestry. Although race and ethnicity are related, race refers to a person's physical appearance, such as skin color and eye color. Ethnicity, on the other hand, refers to communality in cultural heritage, language, social practice, traditions, and geopolitical factors. Genetic ancestry inferred using ancestry informative markers (AIMs) is based on genetic/genomic data. Phenotype-based race/ethnicity information and data computed using AIMs often disagree. For example, self-reporting African Americans can have drastically different levels of African or European ancestry. Genetic analysis of individual ancestry shows that some self-identified African Americans have up to 99{{\%}} of European ancestry, whereas some self-identified European Americans have substantial admixture from African ancestry. Similarly, African ancestry in the Latino population varies between 3{{\%}} in Mexican Americans to 16{{\%}} in Puerto Ricans. The implication of this is that, in African American or Latino populations, self-reported ancestry may not be as accurate as direct assessment of individual genomic information in predicting treatment outcomes. To better understand human genetic variation in the context of health disparities, we suggest using "ancestry" (or biogeographical ancestry) to describe actual genetic variation, "race" to describe health disparity in societies characterized by racial categories, and "ethnicity" to describe traditions, lifestyle, diet, and values. We also suggest using ancestry informative markers for precise characterization of individuals' biological ancestry. Understanding the sources of human genetic variation and the causes of health disparities could lead to interventions that would improve the health of all individuals.},

Thousands of in vivo phosphorylation sites have been identified, mostly by proteome-wide mapping. However, systematically matching these sites to specific kinases is presently infeasible, due to limited specificity of consensus motifs, and the influence of contextual factors, such as protein scaffolds, localization, and expression, on cellular substrate specificity. We have developed an approach (NetworKIN) that augments motif-based predictions with the network context of kinases and phosphoproteins. The latter provides 60{{\%}}-80{{\%}} of the computational capability to assign in vivo substrate specificity. NetworKIN pinpoints kinases responsible for specific phosphorylations and yields a 2.5-fold improvement in the accuracy with which phosphorylation networks can be constructed. Applying this approach to DNA damage signaling, we show that 53BP1 and Rad50 are phosphorylated by CDK1 and ATM, respectively. We describe a scalable strategy to evaluate predictions, which suggests that BCLAF1 is a GSK-3 substrate.},

Significantly, this leads to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) stress and activation of type 1 interferon, which stimulates anti-tumor T cell immunity and restrains tumor growth. Furthermore, LSD1 depletion enhances tumor immunogenicity and T cell infiltration in poorly immunogenic tumors and elicits significant responses of checkpoint blockade-refractory mouse melanoma to anti-PD-1 therapy. Consistently, TCGA data analysis shows an inverse correlation between LSD1 expression and CD8+ T cell infiltration in various human cancers. Our study identifies LSD1 as a potent inhibitor of anti-tumor immunity and responsiveness to immunotherapy and suggests LSD1 inhibition combined with PD-(L)1 blockade as a novel cancer treatment strategy.},

Ordering gene expression traits relative to one another and relative to other complex traits is achieved by systematically testing whether variations in DNA that lead to variations in relative transcript abundances statistically support an independent, causative or reactive function relative to the complex traits under consideration. We show that this approach can predict transcriptional responses to single gene-perturbation experiments using gene-expression data in the context of a segregating mouse population.

Standard statistical tests, such as the t-test are not suited for detecting these translocations, but a simple test based on robust centering and scaling of the data to help detect outlier samples, followed by a search for pairs of samples with mutually exclusive outliers, may be used to find genes involved in recurrent translocations.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The clinical course of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is highly variable; some patients follow an indolent course, but others progress to a more advanced stage. The mutational status of rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGVH) genes in CLL is a feature that is widely recognized for dividing patients into groups that are related to their prognoses. However, the regulatory programs associated with the IGVH statuses are poorly understood, and markers that can precisely predict survival outcomes have yet to be identified. METHODS In this study, (i) we reconstructed gene regulatory networks in CLL by applying an information-theoretic approach to the expression profiles of 5 cohorts. (ii) We applied master regulator analysis (MRA) to these networks to identify transcription factors (TFs) that regulate an IGVH mutational status signature. The IGVH mutational status signature was developed by searching for differentially expressed genes between the IGVH mutational statuses in numerous CLL cohorts. (iii) To evaluate the biological implication of the inferred regulators, prognostic values were determined using time to treatment (TTT) and overall survival (OS) in two different cohorts. RESULTS A robust IGVH expression signature was obtained, and various TFs emerged as regulators of the signature in most of the reconstructed networks. The TF targets expression profiles exhibited significant differences with respect to survival, which allowed the definition of a reduced profile with a high value for OS. TCF7 and its targets stood out for their roles in progression. CONCLUSION TFs and their targets, which were obtained merely from inferred regulatory associations, have prognostic implications and reflect a regulatory context for prognosis.},

By analysis of cells with manipulated expression of either CD44 or MYCN, we demonstrate that transfection of cells with a CD44 full-length cDNA construct produced a functional receptor in single copy MYCN cells and a nonfunctional CD44 receptor in MYCN amplified cells, similar to the CD44 receptor expressed by cells with enforced MYCN. Analysis of the in vivo growth properties of the transfectants revealed that the restoration of a functional CD44 receptor in nonamplified cells resulted in the suppression of in vivo cell growth, therefore linking the MYCN-related lack of hyaluronic acid-binding function of CD44 to the highly tumorigenic properties of a subset of neuroblastoma cells.},

  abstract = {Aberrant glycosylation, a common feature associated with malignancy, has been implicated in important events during cancer progression. Our understanding of the role of glycans in cancer has grown exponentially in the last few years, concurrent with important advances in glycomics and glycoproteomic technologies, paving the way for the validation of a number of glycan structures as potential glycobiomarkers. However, the molecular bases underlying cancer-associated glycan modifications are still far from understood. Glycans exhibit a natural heterogeneity, crucial for their diverse functional roles as specific carriers of biologically-relevant information. This information is decoded by families of proteins named lectins, including siglecs, C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) and galectins. Siglecs, sialic-acid binding transmembrane lectins, are primarily expressed on the surface of immune cells and differentially control innate and adaptive immune responses. Among CLRs, selectins are a family of cell adhesion molecules that mediate interactions between cancer cells and platelets, leukocytes and endothelial cells, thus facilitating tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Galectins, a family of soluble proteins that bind {$\beta$}-galactoside-containing glycans, have been implicated in diverse events associated with cancer biology such as apoptosis, homotypic cell aggregation, angiogenesis, cell migration and tumor-immune escape. Consequently, individual members of these lectin families have become promising targets for the design of novel anticancer therapies. During the past decade a number of inhibitors of lectin-glycan interactions have been developed including small-molecule inhibitors, multivalent saccharide ligands, and more recently peptides and peptidomimetics have offered alternatives for tackling tumor progression. In this article, we review the current status of the discovery and development of chemical lectin inhibitors and discuss novel strategies to limit cancer progression by targeting lectin-glycan interactions.},

Based on the prediction of multiple drug target pathway activation, we derive a combinatorial regimen co-targeting two mutually exclusive pathways for the metastatic cancer cells. This combinatorial strategy shows significant increase in the treatment efficacy over monotherapy in the experimental validation using patient-derived xenograft platforms in vitro and in vivo. Our findings demonstrate the investigational application of single-cell RNA-seq in the design of an anticancer regimen. The approach may overcome intratumoral heterogeneity which hampers the success of precision medicine.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION High-throughput data is providing a comprehensive view of the molecular changes in cancer tissues. New technologies allow for the simultaneous genome-wide assay of the state of genome copy number variation, gene expression, DNA methylation and epigenetics of tumor samples and cancer cell lines. Analyses of current data sets find that genetic alterations between patients can differ but often involve common pathways. It is therefore critical to identify relevant pathways involved in cancer progression and detect how they are altered in different patients. RESULTS We present a novel method for inferring patient-specific genetic activities incorporating curated pathway interactions among genes. A gene is modeled by a factor graph as a set of interconnected variables encoding the expression and known activity of a gene and its products, allowing the incorporation of many types of omic data as evidence. The method predicts the degree to which a pathway's activities (e.g. internal gene states, interactions or high-level 'outputs') are altered in the patient using probabilistic inference. Compared with a competing pathway activity inference approach called SPIA, our method identifies altered activities in cancer-related pathways with fewer false-positives in both a glioblastoma multiform (GBM) and a breast cancer dataset. PARADIGM identified consistent pathway-level activities for subsets of the GBM patients that are overlooked when genes are considered in isolation. Further, grouping GBM patients based on their significant pathway perturbations divides them into clinically-relevant subgroups having significantly different survival outcomes. These findings suggest that therapeutics might be chosen that target genes at critical points in the commonly perturbed pathway(s) of a group of patients.

  abstract = {The genetic alterations that give rise to childhood cancer are less well studied than those that give rise to adult cancers. Two papers in this issue report some of the first pan-cancer analyses of childhood cancers. Stefan Pfister and colleagues studied germline and somatic genomes from 914 young cancer patients, including children, adolescents and young adults. The tumour samples comprised 24 distinct molecular cancer types, including the most frequent and clinically relevant childhood cancers. The team characterized somatic mutation frequencies, genomic alterations, including structural variations and copy-number analysis, and mutational signatures. They found signatures associated with deficiencies of double-stranded break repair across all cancer types. Additionally, 7.6{{\%}} of patients carried a likely pathogenic germline variant in a candidate cancer predisposition gene. Jinghui Zhang and colleagues analysed the genomes, exomes and transcriptomes of 1,699 paediatric leukaemias and solid tumours. They identified 142 driver genes in paediatric cancers, over half of which were specific to a single histotype. They also characterized copy number alterations and structural variation and identified 11 mutational signatures. Together, these papers provide a comprehensive resource for genomic alterations across common paediatric tumours, and highlight differences compared with the genomic alterations seen in adult cancers.},

  abstract = {The standard approach to the analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is based on testing each position in the genome individually for statistical significance of its association with the phenotype under investigation. To improve the analysis of GWAS, we propose a combination of machine learning and statistical testing that takes correlation structures within the set of SNPs under investigation in a mathematically well-controlled manner into account. The novel two-step algorithm, COMBI, first trains a support vector machine to determine a subset of candidate SNPs and then performs hypothesis tests for these SNPs together with an adequate threshold correction. Applying COMBI to data from a WTCCC study (2007) and measuring performance as replication by independent GWAS published within the 2008-2015 period, we show that our method outperforms ordinary raw p-value thresholding as well as other state-of-the-art methods. COMBI presents higher power and precision than the examined alternatives while yielding fewer false (i.e. non-replicated) and more true (i.e. replicated) discoveries when its results are validated on later GWAS studies. More than 80{{\%}} of the discoveries made by COMBI upon WTCCC data have been validated by independent studies. Implementations of the COMBI method are available as a part of the GWASpi toolbox 2.0.},

Ethnic differences in survival after childhood ALL have been reported in many clinical studies, with poorer survival observed among African Americans or those with Hispanic ethnicity when compared with European Americans or Asians. The causes of ethnic differences remain uncertain, although both genetic and non-genetic factors are likely important. Interrogating genome-wide germline SNP genotypes in an unselected large cohort of children with ALL, we observed that the component of genomic variation that co-segregated with Native American ancestry was associated with risk of relapse (P = 0.0029) even after adjusting for known prognostic factors (P = 0.017). Ancestry-related differences in relapse risk were abrogated by the addition of a single extra phase of chemotherapy, indicating that modifications to therapy can mitigate the ancestry-related risk of relapse.},

However, the impact of such data is not fully exploited due to a limited availability of multi-omic data integration tools and methods. In this paper, we discuss the interplay between gene expression and epigenetic markers/transcription factors. We show how integrating ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data can help to elucidate gene regulatory mechanisms. In particular, we discuss the two following questions: i) Can transcription factor occupancies or histone modification data predict gene expression? ii) Can ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data be used to infer gene regulatory networks? We propose potential directions for statistical data integration. We discuss the importance of incorporating underestimated aspects (such as alternative splicing and long-range chromatin interactions). We also highlight the lack of data benchmarks and the need to develop tools for data integration from a statistical viewpoint, designed in the spirit of reproducible research.},

These methods identify recurrent mutations in regulatory elements upstream of PLEKHS1, WDR74 and SDHD, as well as previously identified mutations in the TERT promoter. SDHD promoter mutations are frequent in melanoma and are associated with reduced gene expression and poor prognosis.

  abstract = {Differential co-expression analysis is an emerging strategy for characterizing disease related dysregulation of gene expression regulatory networks. Given pre-defined sets of biological samples, such analysis aims at identifying genes that are co-expressed in one, but not in the other set of samples. We developed a novel probabilistic framework for jointly uncovering contexts (i.e. groups of samples) with specific co-expression patterns, and groups of genes with different co-expression patterns across such contexts. In contrast to current clustering and bi-clustering procedures, the implicit similarity measure in this model used for grouping biological samples is based on the clustering structure of genes within each sample and not on traditional measures of gene expression level similarities. Within this framework, biological samples with widely discordant expression patterns can be placed in the same context as long as the co-clustering structure of genes is concordant within these samples. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to date for unsupervised differential co-expression analysis in this generality. When applied to the problem of identifying molecular subtypes of breast cancer, our method identified reproducible patterns of differential co-expression across several independent expression datasets. Sample groupings induced by these patterns were highly informative of the disease outcome. Expression patterns of differentially co-expressed genes provided new insights into the complex nature of the ER{$\alpha$} regulatory network. We demonstrated that the use of the co-clustering structure as the similarity measure in the unsupervised analysis of sample gene expression profiles provides valuable information about expression regulatory networks.},

For example, weighted gene co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray samples. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation network methodology have been described in separate publications, there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial. The WGCNA R software package is a comprehensive collection of R functions for performing various aspects of weighted correlation network analysis. The package includes functions for network construction, module detection, gene selection, calculations of topological properties, data simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external software. Along with the R package we also present R software tutorials. While the methods development was motivated by gene expression data, the underlying data mining approach can be applied to a variety of different settings. The WGCNA package provides R functions for weighted correlation network analysis, e.g. co-expression network analysis of gene expression data. The R package along with its source code and additional material are freely available at http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/labs/horvath/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA .},

  abstract = {Genetic risk for breast cancer is conferred by a combination of multiple variants of small effect. To better understand how risk loci might combine, we examined whether risk-associated genes share regulatory mechanisms. We created a breast cancer gene regulatory network comprising transcription factors and groups of putative target genes (regulons) and asked whether specific regulons are enriched for genes associated with risk loci via expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). We identified 36 overlapping regulons that were enriched for risk loci and formed a distinct cluster within the network, suggesting shared biology. The risk transcription factors driving these regulons are frequently mutated in cancer and lie in two opposing subgroups, which relate to estrogen receptor (ER)(+) luminal A or luminal B and ER(-) basal-like cancers and to different luminal epithelial cell populations in the adult mammary gland. Our network approach provides a foundation for determining the regulatory circuits governing breast cancer, to identify targets for intervention, and is transferable to other disease settings.},

  volume = {5},

  abstract = {Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extra-cranial solid tumor of childhood and arises from developing sympathetic nervous system. Most primary tumors localize in the abdomen, the adrenal gland, or lumbar sympathetic ganglia. Amplification in tumor cells of MYCN, the major oncogenic driver, patients' age over 18 months, and the presence at diagnosis of a metastatic disease (stage IV, M) identify NB at high risk of treatment failure. Conventional therapies did not significantly improve the overall survival of these patients. Moreover, the limited landscape of somatic mutations detected in NB is hampering the development of novel pharmacological approaches. Major efforts aim to identify novel NB-associated surface molecules that activate immune responses and/or direct drugs to tumor cells and tumor-associated vessels. PVR (Poliovirus Receptor) and B7-H3 are promising targets, since they are expressed by most high-risk NB, are upregulated in tumor vasculature and are essential for tumor survival/invasiveness. PVR is a ligand of DNAM-1 activating receptor that triggers the cytolytic activity of natural killer (NK) cells against NB. In animal models, targeting of PVR with an attenuated oncolytic poliovirus induced tumor regression and elimination. Also B7-H3 was successfully targeted in preclinical studies and is now being tested in phase I/II clinical trials. B7-H3 down-regulates NK cytotoxicity, providing NB with a mechanism of escape from immune response. The immunosuppressive potential of NB can be enhanced by the release of soluble factors that impair NK cell function and/or recruitment. Among these, TGF-{$\beta$}1 modulates the cytotoxicity receptors and the chemokine receptor repertoire of NK cells. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on the main cell surface molecules and soluble mediators that modulate the function of NK cells in NB, considering the pros and cons that must be taken into account in the design of novel NK cell-based immunotherapeutic approaches.},

  issn = {1362-4962},
  abstract = {mRNA polyadenylation is an essential step for the maturation of almost all eukaryotic mRNAs, and is tightly coupled with termination of transcription in defining the 3'-end of genes. Large numbers of human and mouse genes harbor alternative polyadenylation sites [poly(A) sites] that lead to mRNA variants containing different 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) and/or encoding distinct protein sequences. Here, we examined the conservation and divergence of different types of alternative poly(A) sites across human, mouse, rat and chicken. We found that the 3'-most poly(A) sites tend to be more conserved than upstream ones, whereas poly(A) sites located upstream of the 3'-most exon, also termed intronic poly(A) sites, tend to be much less conserved. Genes with longer evolutionary history are more likely to have alternative polyadenylation, suggesting gain of poly(A) sites through evolution. We also found that nonconserved poly(A) sites are associated with transposable elements (TEs) to a much greater extent than conserved ones, albeit less frequently utilized. Different classes of TEs have different characteristics in their association with poly(A) sites via exaptation of TE sequences into polyadenylation elements. Our results establish a conservation pattern for alternative poly(A) sites in several vertebrate species, and indicate that the 3'-end of genes can be dynamically modified by TEs through evolution.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex multifactorial disorder with poorly characterized pathogenesis. Our understanding of this disease would thus benefit from an approach that addresses this complexity by elucidating the regulatory networks that are dysregulated in the neural compartment of AD patients, across distinct brain regions. Here, we use a Systems Biology (SB) approach, which has been highly successful in the dissection of cancer related phenotypes, to reverse engineer the transcriptional regulation layer of human neuronal cells and interrogate it to infer candidate Master Regulators (MRs) responsible for disease progression. Analysis of gene expression profiles from laser-captured neurons from AD and controls subjects, using the Algorithm for the Reconstruction of Accurate Cellular Networks (ARACNe), yielded an interactome consisting of 488,353 transcription-factor/target interactions. Interrogation of this interactome, using the Master Regulator INference algorithm (MARINa), identified an unbiased set of candidate MRs causally responsible for regulating the transcriptional signature of AD progression. Experimental assays in autopsy-derived human brain tissue showed that three of the top candidate MRs (YY1, p300 and ZMYM3) are indeed biochemically and histopathologically dysregulated in AD brains compared to controls. Our results additionally implicate p53 and loss of acetylation homeostasis in the neurodegenerative process. This study suggests that an integrative, SB approach can be applied to AD and other neurodegenerative diseases, and provide significant novel insight on the disease progression.},

The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list-reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the "tumor microenvironment." Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer.},

  abstract = {UNLABELLED BACKGROUND Cancer outlier profile analysis (COPA) has proven to be an effective approach to analyzing cancer expression data, leading to the discovery of the TMPRSS2 and ETS family gene fusion events in prostate cancer. However, the original COPA algorithm did not identify down-regulated outliers, and the currently available R package implementing the method is similarly restricted to the analysis of over-expressed outliers. Here we present a modified outlier detection method, mCOPA, which contains refinements to the outlier-detection algorithm, identifies both over- and under-expressed outliers, is freely available, and can be applied to any expression dataset. RESULTS We compare our method to other feature-selection approaches, and demonstrate that mCOPA frequently selects more-informative features than do differential expression or variance-based feature selection approaches, and is able to recover observed clinical subtypes more consistently. We demonstrate the application of mCOPA to prostate cancer expression data, and explore the use of outliers in clustering, pathway analysis, and the identification of tumour suppressors. We analyse the under-expressed outliers to identify known and novel prostate cancer tumour suppressor genes, validating these against data in Oncomine and the Cancer Gene Index. We also demonstrate how a combination of outlier analysis and pathway analysis can identify molecular mechanisms disrupted in individual tumours. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrate that mCOPA offers advantages, compared to differential expression or variance, in selecting outlier features, and that the features so selected are better able to assign samples to clinically annotated subtypes. Further, we show that the biology explored by outlier analysis differs from that uncovered in differential expression or variance analysis. mCOPA is an important new tool for the exploration of cancer datasets and the discovery of new cancer subtypes, and can be combined with pathway and functional analysis approaches to discover mechanisms underpinning heterogeneity in cancers.},

  abstract = {The acute cellular response to stress generates a subpopulation of reversibly stress-tolerant cells under conditions that are lethal to the majority of the population. Stress tolerance is attributed to heterogeneity of gene expression within the population to ensure survival of a minority. We performed whole transcriptome sequencing analyses of metastatic human breast cancer cells subjected to the chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel at the single-cell and population levels. Here we show that specific transcriptional programs are enacted within untreated, stressed, and drug-tolerant cell groups while generating high heterogeneity between single cells within and between groups. We further demonstrate that drug-tolerant cells contain specific RNA variants residing in genes involved in microtubule organization and stabilization, as well as cell adhesion and cell surface signaling. In addition, the gene expression profile of drug-tolerant cells is similar to that of untreated cells within a few doublings. Thus, single-cell analyses reveal the dynamics of the stress response in terms of cell-specific RNA variants driving heterogeneity, the survival of a minority population through generation of specific RNA variants, and the efficient reconversion of stress-tolerant cells back to normalcy.},

A pathway-based analysis may shed light by projecting candidate genes onto protein functional relationship networks. We are building such a pathway-based analysis system. We have constructed a protein functional interaction network by extending curated pathways with non-curated sources of information, including protein-protein interactions, gene coexpression, protein domain interaction, Gene Ontology (GO) annotations and text-mined protein interactions, which cover close to 50{{\%}} of the human proteome. By applying this network to two glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) data sets and projecting cancer candidate genes onto the network, we found that the majority of GBM candidate genes form a cluster and are closer than expected by chance, and the majority of GBM samples have sequence-altered genes in two network modules, one mainly comprising genes whose products are localized in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane, and another comprising gene products in the nucleus. Both modules are highly enriched in known oncogenes, tumor suppressors and genes involved in signal transduction. Similar network patterns were also found in breast, colorectal and pancreatic cancers. We have built a highly reliable functional interaction network upon expert-curated pathways and applied this network to the analysis of two genome-wide GBM and several other cancer data sets. The network patterns revealed from our results suggest common mechanisms in the cancer biology. Our system should provide a foundation for a network or pathway-based analysis platform for cancer and other diseases.},

Here, we assessed the protocol sensitivity and accuracy of many published data sets, on the basis of spike-in standards and uniform data processing. For our workflow, we developed a flexible tool for counting the number of unique molecular identifiers (https://github.com/vals/umis/). We compared 15 protocols computationally and 4 protocols experimentally for batch-matched cell populations, in addition to investigating the effects of spike-in molecular degradation.

  volume = {8},
  issn = {1932-6203},
  abstract = {Neuroblastoma is an embryonic tumor arising from immature sympathetic nervous system cells. Recurrent genomic alterations include MYCN and ALK amplification as well as recurrent patterns of gains and losses of whole or large partial chromosome segments. A recent whole genome sequencing effort yielded no frequently recurring mutations in genes other than those affecting ALK. However, the study further stresses the importance of DNA copy number alterations in this disease, in particular for genes implicated in neuritogenesis. Here we provide additional evidence for the importance of focal DNA copy number gains and losses, which are predominantly observed in MYCN amplified tumors. A focal 5 kb gain encompassing the MYCN regulated miR-17{$\sim$}92 cluster as sole gene was detected in a neuroblastoma cell line and further analyses of the array CGH data set demonstrated enrichment for other MYCN target genes in focal gains and amplifications. Next we applied an integrated genomics analysis to prioritize MYCN down regulated genes mediated by MYCN driven miRNAs within regions of focal heterozygous or homozygous deletion. We identified RGS5, a negative regulator of G-protein signaling implicated in vascular normalization, invasion and metastasis, targeted by a focal homozygous deletion, as a new MYCN target gene, down regulated through MYCN activated miRNAs. In addition, we expand the miR-17{$\sim$}92 regulatory network controlling TGF{\ss} signaling in neuroblastoma with the ring finger protein 11 encoding gene RNF11, which was previously shown to be targeted by the miR-17{$\sim$}92 member miR-19b. Taken together, our data indicate that focal DNA copy number imbalances in neuroblastoma (1) target genes that are implicated in MYCN signaling, possibly selected to reinforce MYCN oncogene addiction and (2) serve as a resource for identifying new molecular targets for treatment.},

CSCs are a small subpopulation of cells capable of regenerating a tumor and are resistant to conventional anticancer therapies. No CSC therapy has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Because CSCs and normal stem cells share many characteristics, CSC-directed therapies have potential detrimental effects on normal stem cells, tissue maintenance, and development. Designing treatments that specifically target neural CSCs while allowing neural tissue stem cells to normally develop the brain is a major challenge in pediatric neuro-oncology. In recent years, better identification and characterization of neural CSCs, together with identifying differences between CSCs and normal neural stem cells, have been key factors in developing tailored therapeutics for these devastating diseases. This review focuses on the promises and challenges of pediatric neural CSC-directed therapies. We delineate the options currently in use to exhaust the ability of neural CSCs to self-renew. Finally, we suggest a comprehensive approach to combine anti-CSC therapies with other therapeutic approaches to prevent tumor recurrence.},

We have retrospectively reviewed the charts of 94 infants treated for stage 4s NB in centres of the French Society of Paediatric Oncology between 1990 and 2000, and describe the different first-line treatment approaches that were, successively, liver irradiation, chemotherapy using a cyclophosphamide-vincristine regimen, and chemotherapy using a carboplatin-etoposide regimen. The overall survival was 88{{\%}} (+/-7.6{{\%}}), with a mean follow-up of 64 months. Elevated serum neuron-specific enolase ({$>$}100 nmol ml(-1)), ferritin ({$>$}280 ng ml(-1)) and urinary dopamine levels ({$>$}2500 nmol mmol(-1) creatinine) were associated with a poor outcome, as were the genetic markers N-myc amplification and chromosome 1p deletion (P{$<$}0.0005 and P=0.0016, respectively). Patients who required medical intervention at diagnosis fared worse than those who received supportive treatment only (P{$<$}0.005). The clinical evolution observed with the different successive treatment approaches suggests that if infants do require therapy, the prompt initiation of a more intensive regimen such as carboplatin-etoposide may be more beneficial.},

  abstract = {Radiotherapy is one of the mainstays of anticancer treatment, but the relationship between the radiosensitivity of cancer cells and their genomic characteristics is still not well defined. Here, we report the development of a high-throughput platform for measuring radiation survival in vitro and its validation in comparison with conventional clonogenic radiation survival analysis. We combined results from this high-throughput assay with genomic parameters in cell lines from squamous cell lung carcinoma, which is standardly treated by radiotherapy, to identify parameters that predict radiation sensitivity. We showed that activation of NFE2L2, a frequent event in lung squamous cancers, confers radiation resistance. An expression-based, in silico screen nominated inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) as NFE2L2 antagonists. We showed that the selective PI3K inhibitor, NVP-BKM120, both decreased NRF2 protein levels and sensitized NFE2L2 or KEAP1-mutant cells to radiation. We then combined results from this high-throughput assay with single-sample gene set enrichment analysis of gene expression data. The resulting analysis identified pathways implicated in cell survival, genotoxic stress, detoxification, and innate and adaptive immunity as key correlates of radiation sensitivity. The integrative and high-throughput methods shown here for large-scale profiling of radiation survival and genomic features of solid-tumor-derived cell lines should facilitate tumor radiogenomics and the discovery of genotype-selective radiation sensitizers and protective agents.},

We present an integrated analysis of copy number and gene expression in a discovery and validation set of 997 and 995 primary breast tumours, respectively, with long-term clinical follow-up. Inherited variants (copy number variants and single nucleotide polymorphisms) and acquired somatic copy number aberrations (CNAs) were associated with expression in {{\~}}40{{\%}} of genes, with the landscape dominated by cis- and trans-acting CNAs. By delineating expression outlier genes driven in cis by CNAs, we identified putative cancer genes, including deletions in PPP2R2A, MTAP and MAP2K4. Unsupervised analysis of paired DNA\textendash{}RNA profiles revealed novel subgroups with distinct clinical outcomes, which reproduced in the validation cohort. These include a high-risk, oestrogen-receptor-positive 11q13/14 cis-acting subgroup and a favourable prognosis subgroup devoid of CNAs. Trans-acting aberration hotspots were found to modulate subgroup-specific gene networks, including a TCR deletion-mediated adaptive immune response in the `CNA-devoid' subgroup and a basal-specific chromosome 5 deletion-associated mitotic network. Our results provide a novel molecular stratification of the breast cancer population, derived from the impact of somatic CNAs on the transcriptome.},

Here we propose a novel method for inferring causality that is no longer constrained by the conditional dependency arguments that limit the ability of statistical causal inference methods to resolve causal relationships within sets of graphical models that are Markov equivalent. Our method utilizes Bayesian belief propagation to infer the responses of perturbation events on molecular traits given a hypothesized graph structure. A distance measure between the inferred response distribution and the observed data is defined to assess the 'fitness' of the hypothesized causal relationships. To test our algorithm, we infer causal relationships within equivalence classes of gene networks in which the form of the functional interactions that are possible are assumed to be nonlinear, given synthetic microarray and RNA sequencing data. We also apply our method to infer causality in real metabolic network with v-structure and feedback loop. We show that our method can recapitulate the causal structure and recover the feedback loop only from steady-state data which conventional method cannot.},

Multiple lines of evidence including conservation with yeast supported a core network of 641 interactions. Using small interfering RNA knockdowns, we observed that approximately one-third of MAPK-interacting proteins modulated MAPK-mediated signaling. We uncovered the Na-H exchanger NHE1 as a potential MAPK scaffold, found links between HSP90 chaperones and MAPK pathways and identified MUC12 as the human analog to the yeast signaling mucin Msb2. This study makes available a large resource of MAPK interactions and clone libraries, and it illustrates a methodology for probing signaling networks based on functional refinement of experimentally derived protein-interaction maps.},

Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we show that E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3 bind to the proximal MYCN promoter in vivo, specifically in neuroblastoma cell lines expressing MYCN. Inhibition of E2F activity in MYCN-amplified cells by the overexpression of p16(INK4A) reduced MYCN expression. In addition, we provide evidence that E2F proteins are involved in the negative regulation of MYCN by TGF-beta and retinoic acid.

  volume = {4},
  issn = {2051-1426},
  abstract = {Immunotherapies have emerged as one of the most promising approaches to treat patients with cancer. Recently, there have been many clinical successes using checkpoint receptor blockade, including T cell inhibitory receptors such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death-1 (PD-1). Despite demonstrated successes in a variety of malignancies, responses only typically occur in a minority of patients in any given histology. Additionally, treatment is associated with inflammatory toxicity and high cost. Therefore, determining which patients would derive clinical benefit from immunotherapy is a compelling clinical question. Although numerous candidate biomarkers have been described, there are currently three FDA-approved assays based on PD-1 ligand expression (PD-L1) that have been clinically validated to identify patients who are more likely to benefit from a single-agent anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. Because of the complexity of the immune response and tumor biology, it is unlikely that a single biomarker will be sufficient to predict clinical outcomes in response to immune-targeted therapy. Rather, the integration of multiple tumor and immune response parameters, such as protein expression, genomics, and transcriptomics, may be necessary for accurate prediction of clinical benefit. Before a candidate biomarker and/or new technology can be used in a clinical setting, several steps are necessary to demonstrate its clinical validity. Although regulatory guidelines provide general roadmaps for the validation process, their applicability to biomarkers in the cancer immunotherapy field is somewhat limited. Thus, Working Group 1 (WG1) of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) Immune Biomarkers Task Force convened to address this need. In this two volume series, we discuss pre-analytical and analytical (Volume I) as well as clinical and regulatory (Volume II) aspects of the validation process as applied to predictive biomarkers for cancer immunotherapy. To illustrate the requirements for validation, we discuss examples of biomarker assays that have shown preliminary evidence of an association with clinical benefit from immunotherapeutic interventions. The scope includes only those assays and technologies that have established a certain level of validation for clinical use (fit-for-purpose). Recommendations to meet challenges and strategies to guide the choice of analytical and clinical validation design for specific assays are also provided.},

The aim of this study was to identify differential features regarding DNA copy number alterations, {$\alpha$}-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) protein expression, and the presence of tumor-associated inflammatory cells. Thirty-one NB patients older than 10 years who were included in the Spanish NB Registry were considered for the current study; seven young and middle-aged adult patients (range 18-60 years) formed part of the cohort. We performed single nucleotide polymorphism arrays, immunohistochemistry for immune markers (CD4, CD8, CD20, CD11b, CD11c, and CD68), and ATRX protein expression. Assorted genetic profiles were found with a predominant presence of a segmental chromosome aberration (SCA) profile. Preadolescent and adolescent NB tumors showed a higher number of SCA, including 17q gain and 11q deletion. There was also a marked infiltration of immune cells, mainly high and heterogeneous, in young and middle-aged adult tumors. ATRX negative expression was present in the tumors. The characteristics of preadolescent, adolescent, young adult, and middle-aged adult NB tumors are different, not only from childhood NB tumors but also from each other. Similar examinations of a larger number of such tumor tissues from cooperative groups should lead to a better older age-dependent tumor pattern and to innovative, individual risk-adapted therapeutic approaches for these patients.},

  title = {{{ETHNOPRED}}: A Novel Machine Learning Method for Accurate Continental and Sub-Continental Ancestry Identification and Population Stratification Correction},
  volume = {14},
  issn = {1471-2105},
  abstract = {Population stratification is a systematic difference in allele frequencies between subpopulations. This can lead to spurious association findings in the case-control genome wide association studies (GWASs) used to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with disease-linked phenotypes. Methods such as self-declared ancestry, ancestry informative markers, genomic control, structured association, and principal component analysis are used to assess and correct population stratification but each has limitations. We provide an alternative technique to address population stratification. We propose a novel machine learning method, ETHNOPRED, which uses the genotype and ethnicity data from the HapMap project to learn ensembles of disjoint decision trees, capable of accurately predicting an individual's continental and sub-continental ancestry. To predict an individual's continental ancestry, ETHNOPRED produced an ensemble of 3 decision trees involving a total of 10 SNPs, with 10-fold cross validation accuracy of 100{{\%}} using HapMap II dataset. We extended this model to involve 29 disjoint decision trees over 149 SNPs, and showed that this ensemble has an accuracy of {$\geq$} 99.9{{\%}}, even if some of those 149 SNP values were missing. On an independent dataset, predominantly of Caucasian origin, our continental classifier showed 96.8{{\%}} accuracy and improved genomic control's {$\lambda$} from 1.22 to 1.11. We next used the HapMap III dataset to learn classifiers to distinguish European subpopulations (North-Western vs. Southern), East Asian subpopulations (Chinese vs. Japanese), African subpopulations (Eastern vs. Western), North American subpopulations (European vs. Chinese vs. African vs. Mexican vs. Indian), and Kenyan subpopulations (Luhya vs. Maasai). In these cases, ETHNOPRED produced ensembles of 3, 39, 21, 11, and 25 disjoint decision trees, respectively involving 31, 502, 526, 242 and 271 SNPs, with 10-fold cross validation accuracy of 86.5{{\%}} {$\pm$} 2.4{{\%}}, 95.6{{\%}} {$\pm$} 3.9{{\%}}, 95.6{{\%}} {$\pm$} 2.1{{\%}}, 98.3{{\%}} {$\pm$} 2.0{{\%}}, and 95.9{{\%}} {$\pm$} 1.5{{\%}}. However, ETHNOPRED was unable to produce a classifier that can accurately distinguish Chinese in Beijing vs. Chinese in Denver. ETHNOPRED is a novel technique for producing classifiers that can identify an individual's continental and sub-continental heritage, based on a small number of SNPs. We show that its learned classifiers are simple, cost-efficient, accurate, transparent, flexible, fast, applicable to large scale GWASs, and robust to missing values.},

  title = {Targeting {{Suppressive Myeloid Cells Potentiates Checkpoint Inhibitors}} to {{Control Spontaneous Neuroblastoma}}.},
  volume = {22},
  issn = {1078-0432},
  abstract = {PURPOSE Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid cancer type in childhood, and high-risk patients have poor prognosis despite aggressive multimodal treatment. Neuroblastoma-driven inflammation contributes to the induction of suppressive myeloid cells that hamper efficient antitumor immune responses. Therefore, we sought to enhance antitumor immunity by removing immunosuppression mediated by myeloid cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN The prognostic values of myeloid cells are demonstrated by analyzing genomic datasets of neuroblastoma patients. The impact of tumor-derived factors on myelopoiesis and local induction of suppressive myeloid cells is dissected by in vitro culture models using freshly isolated human CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cells, primary human monocytes, and murine bone marrow cells. To test the therapeutic efficacy of BLZ945 as a monotherapy or in combination with checkpoint inhibitors, we used a transgenic murine model (TH-MYCN) that develops aggressive spontaneous neuroblastoma. RESULTS We report that infiltrating CSF-1R(+) myeloid cells predict poor clinical outcome in patients with neuroblastoma. In vitro, neuroblastoma-derived factors interfere with early development of myeloid cells and enable suppressive functions on human monocytes through M-CSF/CSF-1R interaction. In a transgenic mouse model (TH-MYCN) resembling high-risk human neuroblastoma, antagonizing CSF-1R with a selective inhibitor (BLZ945) modulates the induction of human and murine suppressive myeloid cells and efficiently limit tumor progression. While checkpoint inhibitors are insufficient in controlling tumor growth, combining BLZ945 with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies results in superior tumor control. CONCLUSIONS Our results demonstrate the essential role of CSF-1R signaling during the induction of suppressive myeloid cells and emphasize its clinical potential as an immunotherapy for human cancers.

Knowledge of such mutations may improve the understanding of tumorigenesis, direct patient care, and enable genetic counseling of patients and families. MethodsIn 1120 patients younger than 20 years of age, we sequenced the whole genomes (in 595 patients), whole exomes (in 456), or both (in 69). We analyzed the DNA sequences of 565 genes, including 60 that have been associated with autosomal dominant cancer-predisposition syndromes, for the presence of germline mutations. The pathogenicity of the mutations was determined by a panel of medical experts with the use of cancer-specific and locus-specific genetic databases, the medical literature, computational predictions, and second hits identified in the tumor genome. The same approach was used to analyze data from 966 persons who did not have known cancer in the 1000 Genomes Project, and a similar approach was used to analyze data...},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}We present a Bayesian hierarchical model for detecting differentially expressed genes using a mixture prior on the parameters representing differential effects. We formulate an easily interpretable 3-component mixture to classify genes as over-expressed, under-expressed and non-differentially expressed, and model gene variances as exchangeable to allow for variability between genes. We show how the proportion of differentially expressed genes, and the mixture parameters, can be estimated in a fully Bayesian way, extending previous approaches where this proportion was fixed and empirically estimated. Good estimates of the false discovery rates are also obtained.Different parametric families for the mixture components can lead to quite different classifications of genes for a given data set. Using Affymetrix data from a knock out and wildtype mice experiment, we show how predictive model checks can be used to guide the choice between possible mixture priors. These checks show that extending the mixture model to allow extra variability around zero instead of the usual point mass null fits the data better.A software package for R is available.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Neuroblastoma and other pediatric tumors show a paucity of gene mutations, which has sparked an interest in their epigenetic regulation. Several tumor types include phenotypically divergent cells, resembling cells from different lineage development stages. It has been proposed that super-enhancer-associated transcription factor (TF) networks underlie lineage identity, but the role of these enhancers in intratumoral heterogeneity is unknown. Here we show that most neuroblastomas include two types of tumor cells with divergent gene expression profiles. Undifferentiated mesenchymal cells and committed adrenergic cells can interconvert and resemble cells from different lineage differentiation stages. ChIP-seq analysis of isogenic pairs of mesenchymal and adrenergic cells identified a distinct super-enhancer landscape and super-enhancer-associated TF network for each cell type. Expression of the mesenchymal TF PRRX1 could reprogram the super-enhancer and mRNA landscapes of adrenergic cells toward a mesenchymal state. Mesenchymal cells were more chemoresistant in vitro and were enriched in post-therapy and relapse tumors. Two super-enhancer-associated TF networks, which probably mediate lineage control in normal development, thus dominate epigenetic control of neuroblastoma and shape intratumoral heterogeneity.},

  title = {Improved Methods for Multi-Trait Fine Mapping of Pleiotropic Risk Loci.},
  issn = {1367-4811},
  abstract = {MOTIVATION Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of regions in the genome that contain genetic variants that increase risk for complex traits and diseases. However, the variants uncovered in GWAS are typically not biologically causal, but rather, correlated to the true causal variant through linkage disequilibrium (LD). To discern the true causal variant(s), a variety of statistical fine-mapping methods have been proposed to prioritize variants for functional validation. RESULTS In this work we introduce a new approach, fastPAINTOR, that leverages evidence across correlated traits, as well as functional annotation data, to improve fine-mapping accuracy at pleiotropic risk loci. To improve computational efficiency, we describe an new importance sampling scheme to perform model inference. First, we demonstrate in simulations that by leveraging functional annotation data, fastPAINTOR increases fine-mapping resolution relative to existing methods. Next, we show that jointly modeling pleiotropic risk regions improves fine-mapping resolution compared to standard single trait and pleiotropic fine mapping strategies. We report a reduction in the number of SNPs required for follow-up in order to capture 90{{\%}} of the causal variants from 23 SNPs per locus using a single trait to 12 SNPs when fine-mapping two traits simultaneously. Finally, we analyze summary association data from a large-scale GWAS of lipids and show that these improvements are largely sustained in real data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION The fastPAINTOR framework is implemented in the PAINTOR v3.0 package which is publicly available to the research community http://bogdan.bioinformatics.ucla.edu/software/paintor CONTACT: gkichaev@ucla.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  title = {Applying Genome-Wide Gene-Based Expression Quantitative Trait Locus Mapping to Study Population Ancestry and Pharmacogenetics},
  volume = {15},
  issn = {1471-2164},
  abstract = {Gene-based analysis has become popular in genomic research because of its appealing biological and statistical properties compared with those of a single-locus analysis. However, only a few, if any, studies have discussed a mapping of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in a gene-based framework. Neither study has discussed ancestry-informative eQTL nor investigated their roles in pharmacogenetics by integrating single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based eQTL (s-eQTL) and gene-based eQTL (g-eQTL). In this g-eQTL mapping study, the transcript expression levels of genes (transcript-level genes; T-genes) were correlated with the SNPs of genes (sequence-level genes; S-genes) by using a method of gene-based partial least squares (PLS). Ancestry-informative transcripts were identified using a rank-score-based multivariate association test, and ancestry-informative eQTL were identified using Fisher's exact test. Furthermore, key ancestry-predictive eQTL were selected in a flexible discriminant analysis. We analyzed SNPs and gene expression of 210 independent people of African-, Asian- and European-descent. We identified numerous cis- and trans-acting g-eQTL and s-eQTL for each population by using PLS. We observed ancestry information enriched in eQTL. Furthermore, we identified 2 ancestry-informative eQTL associated with adverse drug reactions and/or drug response. Rs1045642, located on MDR1, is an ancestry-informative eQTL (P = 2.13E-13, using Fisher's exact test) associated with adverse drug reactions to amitriptyline and nortriptyline and drug responses to morphine. Rs20455, located in KIF6, is an ancestry-informative eQTL (P = 2.76E-23, using Fisher's exact test) associated with the response to statin drugs (e.g., pravastatin and atorvastatin). The ancestry-informative eQTL of drug biotransformation genes were also observed; cross-population cis-acting expression regulators included SPG7, TAP2, SLC7A7, and CYP4F2. Finally, we also identified key ancestry-predictive eQTL and established classification models with promising training and testing accuracies in separating samples from close populations. In summary, we developed a gene-based PLS procedure and a SAS macro for identifying g-eQTL and s-eQTL. We established data archives of eQTL for global populations. The program and data archives are accessible at http://www.stat.sinica.edu.tw/hsinchou/genetics/eQTL/HapMapII.htm . Finally, the results from our investigations regarding the interrelationship between eQTL, ancestry information, and pharmacodynamics provide rich resources for future eQTL studies and practical applications in population genetics and medical genetics.},

Here we present a systematic analysis using different measurement modalities of tumour purity in {$>$}10,000 samples across 21 cancer types from the Cancer Genome Atlas. Patients are stratified according to clinical features in an attempt to detect clinical differences driven by purity levels. We demonstrate the confounding effect of tumour purity on correlating and clustering tumours with transcriptomics data. Finally, using a differential expression method that accounts for tumour purity, we find an immunotherapy gene signature in several cancer types that is not detected by traditional differential expression analyses.},

Naive B cells, characterized by the expression of cell cycle-inhibitory and antiapoptotic genes, become centroblasts by inducing an atypical proliferation program lacking c-Myc expression, switching to a proapoptotic program, and down-regulating cytokine, chemokine, and adhesion receptors. The transition from GC to memory cells is characterized by a return to a phenotype similar to that of naive cells except for an apoptotic program primed for both death and survival and for changes in the expression of cell surface receptors including IL-2 receptor beta.

  volume = {8},
  issn = {1756-994X},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND The diversity of clinical tumor profiling approaches (small panels to whole exomes with matched or unmatched germline analysis) may engender uncertainty about their benefits and liabilities, particularly in light of reported germline false positives in tumor-only profiling and use of global mutational and/or neoantigen data. The goal of this study was to determine the impact of genomic analysis strategies on error rates and data interpretation across contexts and ancestries. METHODS We modeled common tumor profiling modalities-large (n = 300 genes), medium (n = 48 genes), and small (n = 15 genes) panels-using clinical whole exomes (WES) from 157 patients with lung or colon adenocarcinoma. We created a tumor-only analysis algorithm to assess germline false positive rates, the impact of patient ancestry on tumor-only results, and neoantigen detection. RESULTS After optimizing a germline filtering strategy, the germline false positive rate with tumor-only large panel sequencing was 14 {{\%}} (144/1012 variants). For patients whose tumor-only results underwent molecular pathologist review (n = 91), 50/54 (93 {{\%}}) false positives were correctly interpreted as uncertain variants. Increased germline false positives were observed in tumor-only sequencing of non-European compared with European ancestry patients (p {$<$} 0.001; Fisher's exact) when basic germline filtering approaches were used; however, the ExAC database (60,706 germline exomes) mitigated this disparity (p = 0.53). Matched and unmatched large panel mutational load correlated with WES mutational load (r(2) = 0.99 and 0.93, respectively; p {$<$} 0.001). Neoantigen load also correlated (r(2) = 0.80; p {$<$} 0.001), though WES identified a broader spectrum of neoantigens. Small panels did not predict mutational or neoantigen load. CONCLUSIONS Large tumor-only targeted panels are sufficient for most somatic variant identification and mutational load prediction if paired with expanded germline analysis strategies and molecular pathologist review. Paired germline sequencing reduced overall false positive mutation calls and WES provided the most neoantigens. Without patient-matched germline data, large germline databases are needed to minimize false positive mutation calling and mitigate ethnic disparities.},

  abstract = {The polycomb repressor complex 2 molecule EZH2 is now known to play a role in essential cellular processes, namely, cell fate decisions, cell cycle regulation, senescence, cell differentiation, and cancer development/progression. EZH2 inhibitors have recently been developed; however, their effectiveness and underlying molecular mechanisms in many malignancies have not yet been elucidated in detail. Although the functional role of EZH2 in tumorigenesis in neuroblastoma (NB) has been investigated, mutations of EZH2 have not been reported. A Kaplan\textendash{}Meier analysis on the event free survival and overall survival of NB patients indicated that the high expression of EZH2 correlated with an unfavorable prognosis. In order to elucidate the functional roles of EZH2 in NB tumorigenesis and its aggressiveness, we knocked down EZH2 in NB cell lines using lentivirus systems. The knockdown of EZH2 significantly induced NB cell differentiation, e.g., neurite extension, and the neuronal differentiation markers, NF68 and GAP43. EZH2 inhibitors also induced NB cell differentiation. We performed a comprehensive transcriptome analysis using Human Gene Expression Microarrays and found that NTRK1 (TrkA) is one of the EZH2-related suppression targets. The depletion of NTRK1 canceled EZH2 knockdown-induced NB cell differentiation. Our integrative methylome, transcriptome, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays using NB cell lines and clinical samples clarified that the NTRK1 P1 and P2 promoter regions were regulated differently by DNA methylation and EZH2-related histone modifications. The NTRK1 transcript variants 1/2, which were regulated by EZH2-related H3K27me3 modifications at the P1 promoter region, were strongly expressed in favorable, but not unfavorable NB. The depletion and inhibition of EZH2 successfully induced NTRK1 transcripts and functional proteins. Collectively, these results indicate that EZH2 plays important roles in preventing the differentiation of NB cells and also that EZH2-related NTRK1 transcriptional regulation may be the key pathway for NB cell differentiation.},

  volume = {10},

  abstract = {Purpose Tumor purity is defined as the proportion of cancer cells in the tumor tissue. The impact of tumor purity on colon cancer (CC) prognosis, genetic profile, and microenvironment has not been thoroughly accessed. Materials and methods Clinical and transcriptomic data from three public datasets, GSE17536/17537, GSE39582, and TCGA, were retrospectively collected (n=1,248). Tumor purity of each sample was inferred by a computational method based on transcriptomic data. Survival-related analyses were performed on microarray dataset containing GSE17536/17537 and GSE39582 (n=794), whereas TCGA dataset was utilized for subsequent genomic analysis (n=454). Results Right-sided CC patients showed a significantly lower tumor purity. Low purity CC conferred worse survival, and tumor purity was identified as an independent prognostic factor. Moreover, high tumor purity CC patients benefited more from adjuvant chemotherapy. Subsequent genomic analysis found that the mutation burden was negatively associated with tumor purity, with only APC and KRAS significantly more mutated in high purity CC. However, no somatic copy number alteration event was correlated with tumor purity. Furthermore, immune-related pathways and immunotherapy-associated markers (programmed cell death protein 1 [PD-1], programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1], cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 [CTLA-4], Lymphocyte-activation gene 3 [LAG-3] and T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 [TIM-3]) were highly enriched in low purity samples. Notably, the relative proportion of M2 macrophages and neutrophils, which indicated worse survival in CC, was negatively associated with tumor purity. Conclusion Tumor purity exhibited potential value for CC prognostic stratification as well as adjuvant chemotherapy benefit prediction. The relative worse survival in low purity CC may attribute to higher mutation frequency in key pathways and purity-related microenvironmental changing.},

  abstract = {Growing evidence defines macrophages (M{$\phi$}) as plastic cells with wide-ranging states of activation and expression of different markers that are time and location dependent. Distinct from the simple M1/M2 dichotomy initially proposed, extensive diversity of macrophage phenotypes have been extensively demonstrated as characteristic features of monocyte-macrophage differentiation, highlighting the difficulty of defining complex profiles by a limited number of genes. Since the description of macrophage activation is currently contentious and confusing, the generation of a simple and reliable framework to categorize major M{$\phi$} phenotypes in the context of complex clinical conditions would be extremely relevant to unravel different roles played by these cells in pathophysiological scenarios. In the current study, we integrated transcriptome data using bioinformatics tools to generate two macrophage molecular signatures. We validated our signatures in in vitro experiments and in clinical samples. More importantly, we were able to attribute prognostic and predictive values to components of our signatures. Our study provides a framework to guide the interrogation of macrophage phenotypes in the context of health and disease. The approach described here could be used to propose new biomarkers for diagnosis in diverse clinical settings including dengue infections, asthma and sepsis resolution. Macrophages (M{$\phi$}) are pivotal cells of the immune system that participate in pleiotropic actions 1 . Microenvironmental signals promote the development of M{$\phi$} subsets that secrete specific cytokines and perform distinct functions in regulating and resolving immunity, perpetuation of inflammation},

  volume = {33},
  issn = {1549-4918},
  abstract = {The predominant view of pluripotency regulation proposes a stable ground state with coordinated expression of key transcription factors (TFs) that prohibit differentiation. Another perspective suggests a more complexly regulated state involving competition between multiple lineage-specifying TFs that define pluripotency. These contrasting views were developed from extensive analyses of TFs in pluripotent cells in vitro. An experimentally validated, genome-wide repertoire of the regulatory interactions that control pluripotency within the in vivo cellular contexts is yet to be developed. To address this limitation, we assembled a TF interactome of adult human male germ cell tumors (GCTs) using the Algorithm for the Accurate Reconstruction of Cellular Pathways (ARACNe) to analyze gene expression profiles of 141 tumors comprising pluripotent and differentiated subsets. The network (GCT(Net)) comprised 1,305 TFs, and its ingenuity pathway analysis identified pluripotency and embryonal development as the top functional pathways. We experimentally validated GCT(Net) by functional (silencing) and biochemical (ChIP-seq) analysis of the core pluripotency regulatory TFs POU5F1, NANOG, and SOX2 in relation to their targets predicted by ARACNe. To define the extent of the in vivo pluripotency network in this system, we ranked all TFs in the GCT(Net) according to sharing of ARACNe-predicted targets with those of POU5F1 and NANOG using an odds-ratio analysis method. To validate this network, we silenced the top 10 TFs in the network in H9 embryonic stem cells. Silencing of each led to downregulation of pluripotency and induction of lineage; 7 of the 10 TFs were identified as pluripotency regulators for the first time.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND A recent study reported that relapsed neuroblastomas had frequent RAS-ERK pathway mutations. We herein investigated the effects and pathways of MEK inhibitors, which inhibit the RAS-ERK pathway, as a new molecular-targeted therapy for refractory neuroblastomas. METHOD Five neuroblastoma cell lines were treated with trametinib (MEK inhibitor) or CH5126766 (RAF/MEK inhibitor). Growth inhibition was analyzed using a cell viability assay. ERK phosphorylation and the MYCN expression were analyzed by immunoblotting or immunohistochemistry. RAS/RAF mutations were identified by direct sequencing or through the COSMIC database. RESULTS Both MEK inhibitors showed growth inhibition effects on cells with ERK phosphorylation, but almost no effect on cells without. In immunoblotting analyses, ERK phosphorylation and MYCN expression were suppressed in ERK active cells by these drugs. Furthermore, phosphorylated-ERK immunohistochemistry corresponded to the drug responses. Regarding the relationship between RAS/Raf mutations and ERK phosphorylation, ERK was phosphorylated in one cell line (NLF) without RAS/Raf mutations. CONCLUSION MEK inhibitors are a promising molecular-targeted therapeutic option for ERK active neuroblastomas. The efficacy of MEK inhibitors corresponds to ERK phosphorylation, while RAS/RAF mutations are not always detected in drug-sensitive cells. Phosphorylated-ERK immunohistochemistry is thus a useful method to analyze ERK activity and predict the therapeutic effects of MEK inhibitors.},

  abstract = {Gene expression profiling has revealed that diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) consists of at least two distinct diseases. Patients with one DLBCL subtype, termed activated B cell-like (ABC) DLBCL, have a distinctly inferior prognosis. An untapped potential of gene expression profiling is its ability to identify pathogenic signaling pathways in cancer that are amenable to therapeutic attack. The gene expression profiles of ABC DLBCLs were notable for the high expression of target genes of the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB transcription factors, raising the possibility that constitutive activity of the NF-kappaB pathway may contribute to the poor prognosis of these patients. Two cell line models of ABC DLBCL had high nuclear NF-kappaB DNA binding activity, constitutive IkappaB kinase (IKK) activity, and rapid IkappaB(alpha) degradation that was not seen in cell lines representing the other DLBCL subtype, germinal center B-like (GCB) DLBCL. Retroviral transduction of a super-repressor form of IkappaBalpha or dominant negative forms of IKKbeta was toxic to ABC DLBCL cells but not GCB DLBCL cells. DNA content analysis showed that NF-kappaB inhibition caused both cell death and G1-phase growth arrest. These findings establish the NF-kappaB pathway as a new molecular target for drug development in the most clinically intractable subtype of DLBCL and demonstrate that the two DLBCL subtypes defined by gene expression profiling utilize distinct pathogenetic mechanisms.},

Methods for inferring molecular subtype from histologic images may identify patients most likely to benefit from further genomic testing. To identify patients who could benefit from molecular testing based on H{{\&}}E stained histologic images, we developed an image analysis approach using deep learning. A training set of 571 breast tumors was used to create image-based classifiers for tumor grade, ER status, PAM50 intrinsic subtype, histologic subtype, and risk of recurrence score (ROR-PT). The resulting classifiers were applied to an independent test set (n = 288), and accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of each was assessed on the test set. Histologic image analysis with deep learning distinguished low-intermediate vs. high tumor grade (82{{\%}} accuracy), ER status (84{{\%}} accuracy), Basal-like vs. non-Basal-like (77{{\%}} accuracy), Ductal vs. Lobular (94{{\%}} accuracy), and high vs. low-medium ROR-PT score (75{{\%}} accuracy). Sampling considerations in the training set minimized bias in the test set. Incorrect classification of ER status was significantly more common for Luminal B tumors. These data provide proof of principle that molecular marker status, including a critical clinical biomarker (i.e., ER status), can be predicted with accuracy {$>$}75{{\%}} based on H{{\&}}E features.

Such tests were originally proposed for analyzing gene sets associated with biological processes. The objective evaluation of tests on real measurements has not been possible as it is difficult to decide a priori, which processes will be affected in given experiments. RESULTS: We present a first large study to rigorously assess and compare the performance of gene set enrichment tests on real expression measurements. Gene sets are defined based on the targets of given regulators such as transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs (miRNAs). In contrast to processes, TFs and miRNAs are amenable to direct perturbations, e.g. regulator over-expression or deletion. We assess the ability of 14 different statistical tests to predict the perturbations from expression measurements in Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human. We also analyze how performance depends on the quality and comprehensiveness of the regulator targets via a permutation approach. We find that ANOVA and Wilcoxons test consistently perform better than for instance Kolmogorov-Smirnov and hypergeometric tests. For scenarios where the optimal test is not known, we suggest to combine all evaluated tests into an unweighted consensus, which also performs well in our assessment. Our results provide a guide for the selection of existing tests as well as a basis for the development and assessment of novel tests.},

To address this problem we introduce and experimentally validate a new algorithm, virtual inference of protein activity by enriched regulon analysis (VIPER), for accurate assessment of protein activity from gene expression data. We used VIPER to evaluate the functional relevance of genetic alterations in regulatory proteins across all samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). In addition to accurately infer aberrant protein activity induced by established mutations, we also identified a fraction of tumors with aberrant activity of druggable oncoproteins despite a lack of mutations, and vice versa. In vitro assays confirmed that VIPER-inferred protein activity outperformed mutational analysis in predicting sensitivity to targeted inhibitors.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION Identification of bimodally expressed genes is an important task, as genes with bimodal expression play important roles in cell differentiation, signalling and disease progression. Several useful algorithms have been developed to identify bimodal genes from microarray data. Currently, no method can deal with data from next-generation sequencing, which is emerging as a replacement technology for microarrays. RESULTS We present SIBER (systematic identification of bimodally expressed genes using RNAseq data) for effectively identifying bimodally expressed genes from next-generation RNAseq data. We evaluate several candidate methods for modelling RNAseq count data and compare their performance in identifying bimodal genes through both simulation and real data analysis. We show that the lognormal mixture model performs best in terms of power and robustness under various scenarios. We also compare our method with alternative approaches, including profile analysis using clustering and kurtosis (PACK) and cancer outlier profile analysis (COPA). Our method is robust, powerful, invariant to shifting and scaling, has no blind spots and has a sample-size-free interpretation.

  abstract = {MOTIVATION Gene expression data exhibit common information over the genome. This article shows how data can be analysed from an efficient whole-genome perspective. Further, the methods have been developed so that users with limited expertise in bioinformatics and statistical computing techniques could use and modify this procedure to their own needs. The method outlined first uses a large-scale linear mixed model for the expression data genome-wide, and then uses finite mixture models to separate differentially expressed (DE) from non-DE transcripts. These methods are illustrated through application to an exceptional UK Brain Expression Consortium involving 12 human frozen post-mortem brain regions. RESULTS Fitting linear mixed models has allowed variation in gene expression between different biological states (e.g. brain regions, gender, age) to be investigated. The model can be extended to allow for differing levels of variation between different biological states. Predicted values of the random effects show the effects of each transcript in a particular biological state. Using the UK Brain Expression Consortium data, this approach yielded striking patterns of co-regional gene expression. Fitting the finite mixture model to the effects within each state provides a convenient method to filter transcripts that are DE: these DE transcripts can then be extracted for advanced functional analysis.

Although genome-wide RNAi screening is an effective approach to finding synthetic lethal genes, it is costly and labor-intensive. To illustrate this approach, we identified potentially druggable genes synthetically lethal for p53 using three microarray datasets for gene expression profiles of the NCI-60 cancer cell lines, one next-generation sequencing (RNA-Seq) dataset from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, and one gene expression data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) project. We selected the genes which encoded kinases and had significantly higher expression in the tumors with functional p53 mutations (somatic mutations) than in the tumors without functional p53 mutations as the candidates of druggable synthetic lethal genes for p53. We identified important regulatory networks and functional categories pertinent to these genes, and performed an extensive survey of literature to find experimental evidence that support the synthetic lethality relationships between the genes identified and p53. We also examined the drug sensitivity difference between NCI-60 cell lines with functional p53 mutations and NCI-60 cell lines without functional p53 mutations for the compounds that target the kinases encoded by the genes identified. Our results indicated that some of the candidate genes we identified had been experimentally verified to be synthetic lethal for p53 and promising targets for anticancer therapy while some other genes were putative targets for development of cancer therapeutic agents. Our study indicated that pre-screening of potential synthetic lethal genes using gene expression profiles is a promising approach for improving the efficiency of synthetic lethal RNAi screening.},

Therefore, cell cycle regulators are considered attractive targets in cancer therapy. Intriguingly, animal models demonstrate that some of these proteins are not essential for proliferation of non-transformed cells and development of most tissues. By contrast, many cancers are uniquely dependent on these proteins and hence are selectively sensitive to their inhibition. After decades of research on the physiological functions of cell cycle proteins and their relevance for cancer, this knowledge recently translated into the first approved cancer therapeutic targeting of a direct regulator of the cell cycle. In this Review, we focus on proteins that directly regulate cell cycle progression (such as cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs)), as well as checkpoint kinases, Aurora kinases and Polo-like kinases (PLKs). We discuss the role of cell cycle proteins in cancer, the rationale for targeting them in cancer treatment and results of clinical trials, as well as the future therapeutic potential of various cell cycle inhibitors.},

An ongoing challenge is the identification of biomarkers that predict which patients will benefit from these therapies. Aneuploidy, also known as somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs), is widespread in cancer and is posited to drive tumorigenesis. Analyzing 12 human cancer types, we find that, for most, highly aneuploid tumors show reduced expression of markers of cytotoxic infiltrating immune cells, especially CD8+ T cells, and increased expression of cell proliferation markers. Different types of SCNAs predict the proliferation and immune signatures, implying distinct underlying mechanisms. Using published data from two clinical trials of immune checkpoint blockade therapy for metastatic melanoma, we found that tumor aneuploidy inversely correlates with patient survival. Together with other tumor characteristics such as tumor mutational load, aneuploidy may thus help identify patients most likely to respond to immunotherapy.},

Adjuvant therapy is indicated on the assumption of residual micrometastatic disease. Adjuvant assessment tools for prognosis and prediction of treatment benefit, including Adjuvant! Online, the St Gallen Consensus, Oncotype DX(\textregistered{}) and MammaPrint(\textregistered{}), aid clinical decision making. However, all of these tools have limitations that must be considered in their judicious application. Clinicopathological based tools are critically dependent on accurate, standardized measurement of parameters. Multigene tools are appealing for their objectivity and reproducibility, particularly regarding analysis of proliferation, but these approaches still overlook the biological heterogeneity within tumors evidenced by distinct cell subpopulations with different genomic patterns and function. The greatest treatment challenge remains for patients assessed as intermediate risk of relapse, a problem not overcome by multigene tools. Remarkable diversity in breast cancer dictates that adjuvant management must be biologically driven. Future identification of predictive biomarkers for specific chemotherapy sensitivity may allow targeted use of available agents, including anthracyclines, taxanes and DNA damaging agents. The presence of drug targets and targetable signaling pathways, rather than molecularly defined subgroups, may ultimately drive treatment decisions.},

RESULTS We introduce a beta-Poisson mixture model that can capture the bimodality of the single-cell gene expression distribution. We further integrate the model into the generalized linear model framework in order to perform differential expression analyses. The whole analytical procedure is called BPSC. The results from several real single-cell RNA-seq datasets indicate that {$\sim$}90{{\%}} of the transcripts are well characterized by the beta-Poisson model; the model-fit from BPSC is better than the fit of the standard gamma-Poisson model in {$>$} 80{{\%}} of the transcripts.

  abstract = {Tumors can be depicted as wounds that never heal, and are infiltrated by a large array of inflammatory and immune cells. Tumor-associated chronic inflammation is a hallmark of cancer that fosters progression to a metastatic stage, as has been extensively reviewed lately. Indeed, inflammatory cells persisting in the tumor establish a cross-talk with tumor cells that may result in a phenotype switch into tumor-supporting cells. This has been particularly well described for macrophages and is referred to as tumor-associated 'M2' polarization. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), the embryonic program that loosens cell-cell adherence complexes and endows cells with enhanced migratory and invasive properties, can be co-opted by cancer cells during metastatic progression. Cancer cells that have undergone EMT are more aggressive, displaying increased invasiveness, stem-like features, and resistance to apoptosis. EMT programs can also stimulate the production of proinflammatory factors by cancer cells. Conversely, inflammation is a potent inducer of EMT in tumors. Therefore, the two phenomena may sustain each other, in an alliance for metastasis. This is the focus of this review, where the interconnections between EMT programs and cellular and molecular actors of inflammation are described. We also recapitulate data linking the EMT/inflammation axis to metastasis.},

  abstract = {The MAQC/SEQC consortium has recently compiled a key benchmark that can serve for testing the latest developments in analysis tools for microarray and RNA-seq expression profiling. Such objective benchmarks are required for basic and applied research, and can be critical for clinical and regulatory outcomes. Going beyond the first comparisons presented in the original SEQC study, we here present extended benchmarks including effect strengths typical of common experiments. With artefacts removed by factor analysis and additional filters, for genome scale surveys, the reproducibility of differential expression calls typically exceed 80{{\%}} for all tool combinations examined. This directly reflects the robustness of results and reproducibility across different studies. Similar improvements are observed for the top ranked candidates with the strongest relative expression change, although here some tools clearly perform better than others, with typical reproducibility ranging from 60 to 93{{\%}}. In our benchmark of alternative tools for RNA-seq data analysis we demonstrated the benefits that can be gained by analysing results in the context of other experiments employing a reference standard sample. This allowed the computational identification and removal of hidden confounders, for instance, by factor analysis. In itself, this already substantially improved the empirical False Discovery Rate (eFDR) without changing the overall landscape of sensitivity. Further filtering of false positives, however, is required to obtain acceptable eFDR levels. Appropriate filters noticeably improved agreement of differentially expressed genes both across sites and between alternative differential expression analysis pipelines. An extended abstract of this research paper was selected for the Camda Satellite Meeting to Ismb 2015 by the Camda Programme Committee. The full research paper then underwent one round of Open Peer Review under a responsible Camda Programme Committee member, Lan Hu, PhD (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Digital Biology Center-Cambridge).

  abstract = {The evolution of clinical research traverses a long and fascinating journey. From the first recorded trial of legumes in biblical times to the first randomized controlled of trial of streptomycin in 1946, the history of clinical trial covers a wide variety of challenges - scientific, ethical and regulatory. The famous 1747 scurvy trial conducted by James Lind contained most elements of a controlled trial. The UK Medical Research Council's (MRC) trial of patulin for common cold in 1943 was the first double blind controlled trial. This paved the way for the first randomized control trial of streptomycin in pulmonary tuberculosis carried out in 1946 by MRC of the UK. This landmark trial was a model of meticulousness in design and implementation, with systematic enrolment criteria and data collection compared with the ad hoc nature of other contemporary research. Over the years, as the discipline of controlled trials grew in sophistication and influence, the streptomycin trial continues to be referred to as ground breaking. The ethical advances in human protection include several milestones - Nuremberg Code, Declaration of Helsinki, Belmont Report, and 1996, International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidance. In parallel to ethical guidelines, clinical trials started to become embodied in regulation as government authorities began recognizing a need for controlling medical therapies in the early 20th century. As the scientific advances continue to occur, there will be new ethical and regulatory challenges requiring dynamic updates in ethical and legal framework of clinical trials.},

  abstract = {Abstract Understanding the regulatory mechanisms that are responsible for an organism's response to environmental change is an important issue in molecular biology. A first and important step towards this goal is to detect genes whose expression levels are affected by altered external conditions. A range of methods to test for differential gene expression, both in static as well as in time-course experiments, have been proposed. While these tests answer the question whether a gene is differentially expressed, they do not explicitly address the question when a gene is differentially expressed, although this information may provide insights into the course and causal structure of regulatory programs. In this article, we propose a two-sample test for identifying intervals of differential gene expression in microarray time series. Our approach is based on Gaussian process regression, can deal with arbitrary numbers of replicates, and is robust with respect to outliers. We apply our algorithm to study the resp...},

  abstract = {The NOTCH1 signaling pathway directly links extracellular signals with transcriptional responses in the cell nucleus and plays a critical role during T cell development and in the pathogenesis over 50{{\%}} of human T cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cases. However, little is known about the transcriptional programs activated by NOTCH1. Using an integrative systems biology approach we show that NOTCH1 controls a feed-forward-loop transcriptional network that promotes cell growth. Inhibition of NOTCH1 signaling in T-ALL cells led to a reduction in cell size and elicited a gene expression signature dominated by down-regulated biosynthetic pathway genes. By integrating gene expression array and ChIP-on-chip data, we show that NOTCH1 directly activates multiple biosynthetic routes and induces c-MYC gene expression. Reverse engineering of regulatory networks from expression profiles showed that NOTCH1 and c-MYC govern two directly interconnected transcriptional programs containing common target genes that together regulate the growth of primary T-ALL cells. These results identify c-MYC as an essential mediator of NOTCH1 signaling and integrate NOTCH1 activation with oncogenic signaling pathways upstream of c-MYC.},

Most of biclustering approaches use a measure or cost function that determines the quality of biclusters. In such cases, the development of both a suitable heuristics and a good measure for guiding the search are essential for discovering interesting biclusters in an expression matrix. Nevertheless, not all existing biclustering approaches base their search on evaluation measures for biclusters. There exists a diverse set of biclustering tools that follow different strategies and algorithmic concepts which guide the search towards meaningful results. In this paper we present a extensive survey of biclustering approaches, classifying them into two categories according to whether or not use evaluation metrics within the search method: biclustering algorithms based on evaluation measures and non metric-based biclustering algorithms. In both cases, they have been classified according to the type of meta-heuristics which they are based on.},

  title = {{{FGFR1 mRNA}} and {{Protein Expression}}, Not {{Gene Copy Number}}, {{Predict FGFR TKI Sensitivity}} across {{All Lung Cancer Histologies}}},
  volume = {20},
  abstract = {Purpose: FGFR1 gene copy number (GCN) is being evaluated as a biomarker for FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) response in squamous cell lung cancers (SCC). The exclusive use of FGFR1 GCN for predicting FGFR TKI sensitivity assumes increased GCN is the only mechanism for biologically relevant increases in FGFR1 signaling. Herein, we tested whether FGFR1 mRNA and protein expression may serve as better biomarkers of FGFR TKI sensitivity in lung cancer. Experimental Design: Histologically diverse lung cancer cell lines were submitted to assays for ponatinib sensitivity, a potent FGFR TKI. A tissue microarray composed of resected lung tumors was submitted to FGFR1 GCN, and mRNA analyses and the results were validated with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) lung cancer data. Results: Among 58 cell lines, 14 exhibited ponatinib sensitivity (IC 50 values 50 nmol/L) that correlated with FGFR1 mRNA and protein expression, but not with FGFR1 GCN or histology. Moreover, ponatinib sensitivity associated with mRNA expression of the ligands, FGF2 and FGF9. In resected tumors, 22{{\%}} of adenocarcinomas and 28{{\%}} of SCCs expressed high FGFR1 mRNA. Impor-tantly, only 46{{\%}} of SCCs with increased FGFR1 GCN expressed high mRNA. Lung cancer TCGA data validated these findings and unveiled overlap of FGFR1 mRNA positivity with KRAS and PIK3CA mutations. Conclusions: FGFR1 dependency is frequent across various lung cancer histologies, and FGFR1 mRNA may serve as a better biomarker of FGFR TKI response in lung cancer than FGFR1 GCN. The study provides important and timely insight into clinical testing of FGFR TKIs in lung cancer and other solid tumor types.},

We used whole-genome sequencing to identify multiple new genetic alterations involving BRAF, RAF1, FGFR1, MYB, MYBL1 and genes with histone-related functions, including H3F3A and ATRX, in 39 LGGs and low-grade glioneuronal tumors (LGGNTs).

Transplantation of Trp53-null neonatal astrocytes expressing FGFR1 with the duplication involving the TKD into the brains of nude mice generated high-grade astrocytomas with short latency and 100{{\%}} penetrance. FGFR1 with the duplication induced FGFR1 autophosphorylation and upregulation of the MAPK/ERK and PI3K pathways, which could be blocked by specific inhibitors.

Integrated Genomic Profiling (IGP) utilising DNA/RNA with tumour/normal comparisons in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) compliant setting enables a single assay to provide: therapeutic target prioritisation, novel target discovery/application and comprehensive germline assessment. A prospective study in 35 advanced/refractory cancer patients was conducted using CLIA-compliant IGP. Feasibility was assessed by estimating time to results (TTR), prioritising/assigning putative therapeutic targets, assessing drug access, ascertaining germline alterations, and assessing patient preferences/perspectives on data use/reporting. Therapeutic targets were identified using biointelligence/pathway analyses and interpreted by a Genomic Tumour Board. Seventy-five percent of cases harboured 1-3 therapeutically targetable mutations/case (median 79 mutations of potential functional significance/case). Median time to CLIA-validated results was 116 days with CLIA-validation of targets achieved in 21/22 patients. IGP directed treatment was instituted in 13 patients utilising on/off label FDA approved drugs (n = 9), clinical trials (n = 3) and single patient IND (n = 1). Preliminary clinical efficacy was noted in five patients (two partial response, three stable disease). Although barriers to broader application exist, including the need for wider availability of therapies, IGP in a CLIA-framework is feasible and valuable in selection/prioritisation of anti-cancer therapeutic targets.},

Genetically defined ES models are needed to understand how EF expression changes bone precursor cell differentiation, how ES arises and through which mechanisms of inhibition it can be targeted. We used mesenchymal Prx1-directed conditional EF expression in mice to study bone development and to establish a reliable sarcoma model. EF expression arrested early chondrocyte and osteoblast differentiation due to changed signaling pathways such as hedgehog, WNT or growth factor signaling. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) expressing EF showed high self-renewal capacity and maintained an undifferentiated state despite high apoptosis. Blocking apoptosis through enforced BCL2 family member expression in MSCs promoted efficient and rapid sarcoma formation when transplanted to immunocompromised mice. Mechanistically, high BCL2 family member and CDK4, but low P53 and INK4A protein expression synergized in Ewing-like sarcoma development. Functionally, knockdown of Mcl1 or Cdk4 or their combined pharmacologic inhibition resulted in growth arrest and apoptosis in both established human ES cell lines and EF-transformed mouse MSCs. Combinatorial targeting of survival and cell cycle progression pathways could counteract this aggressive childhood cancer.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE The tumor genomic copy number profile is of prognostic significance in neuroblastoma patients. We have studied the genomic copy number profile of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and compared this with primary tumor arrayCGH (aCGH) at diagnosis. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN In 70 patients, cfDNA genomic copy number profiling was performed using the OncoScan platform. The profiles were classified according to the overall pattern, including numerical chromosome alterations (NCA), segmental chromosome alterations (SCA), and MYCN amplification (MNA). RESULTS Interpretable and dynamic cfDNA profiles were obtained in 66 of 70 and 52 of 70 cases, respectively. An overall identical genomic profile between tumor aCGH and cfDNA was observed in 47 cases (3 NCAs, 22 SCAs, 22 MNAs). In one case, cfDNA showed an additional SCA not detected by tumor aCGH. In 4 of 8 cases with a silent tumor aCGH profile, cfDNA analysis revealed a dynamic profile (3 SCAs, 1 NCA). In 14 cases, cfDNA analysis did not reveal any copy number changes. A total of 378 breakpoints common to the primary tumor and cfDNA of any given patient were identified, 27 breakpoints were seen by tumor aCGH, and 54 breakpoints were seen in cfDNA only, including two cases with interstitial IGFR1 gains and two alterations targeting TERT CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the feasibility of cfDNA copy number profiling in neuroblastoma patients, with a concordance of the overall genomic profile in aCGH and cfDNA dynamic cases of 97{{\%}} and a sensitivity of 77{{\%}}, respectively. Furthermore, neuroblastoma heterogeneity is highlighted, suggesting that cfDNA might reflect genetic alterations of more aggressive cell clones.

The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},

  abstract = {Pharmacologically difficult targets, such as MYC transcription factors, represent a major challenge in cancer therapy. For the childhood cancer neuroblastoma, amplification of the oncogene MYCN is associated with high-risk disease and poor prognosis. Here, we deployed genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screening of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma and found a preferential dependency on genes encoding the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) components EZH2, EED, and SUZ12. Genetic and pharmacological suppression of EZH2 inhibited neuroblastoma growth in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, compared with neuroblastomas without MYCN amplification, MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas expressed higher levels of EZH2. ChIP analysis showed that MYCN binds at the EZH2 promoter, thereby directly driving expression. Transcriptomic and epigenetic analysis, as well as genetic rescue experiments, revealed that EZH2 represses neuronal differentiation in neuroblastoma in a PRC2-dependent manner. Moreover, MYCN-amplified and high-risk primary tumors from patients with neuroblastoma exhibited strong repression of EZH2-regulated genes. Additionally, overexpression of IGFBP3, a direct EZH2 target, suppressed neuroblastoma growth in vitro and in vivo. We further observed strong synergy between histone deacetylase inhibitors and EZH2 inhibitors. Together, these observations demonstrate that MYCN upregulates EZH2, leading to inactivation of a tumor suppressor program in neuroblastoma, and support testing EZH2 inhibitors in patients with MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma.},

Although far from complete, such maps have revealed global topological and dynamic features of interactome networks that relate to known biological properties, suggesting that a human interactome map will provide insight into development and disease mechanisms at a systems level. Here we describe an initial version of a proteome-scale map of human binary protein-protein interactions. Using a stringent, high-throughput yeast two-hybrid system, we tested pairwise interactions among the products of approximately 8,100 currently available Gateway-cloned open reading frames and detected approximately 2,800 interactions. This data set, called CCSB-HI1, has a verification rate of approximately 78{{\%}} as revealed by an independent co-affinity purification assay, and correlates significantly with other biological attributes. The CCSB-HI1 data set increases by approximately 70{{\%}} the set of available binary interactions within the tested space and reveals more than 300 new connections to over 100 disease-associated proteins.

The purpose of this article is to follow the third direction. One important aspect is that the gene sets under analysis are known a priori and are not determined from the experimental data at hand. Our goal is to provide a methodology that helps to identify the relevant structural constituents (phenotypical, experimental design, biological component) that determine gene expression in a group. RESULTS Gene-wise linear models are used to formalize the structural aspects of a study. The full model is contrasted with a reduced model that lacks the relevant design component. A comparison with respect to goodness of fit is made and quantified. An asymptotic test and a permutation test are derived to test the null hypothesis that the reduced model sufficiently explains the observed expression within the gene group of interest. Graphical tools are available to illustrate and interpret the results of the analysis. Examples demonstrate the wide range of application.

Using scoring metrics based on experimental dose-response curves, we assessed 32 methods (31 community-generated approaches and SynGen), four of which performed significantly better than random guessing. We highlight similarities between the methods.

Such efforts should be greatly aided by robust preclinical model systems that reflect the genomic diversity of human cancers and for which detailed genetic and pharmacological annotation is available. Here we describe the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE): a compilation of gene expression, chromosomal copy number and massively parallel sequencing data from 947 human cancer cell lines. When coupled with pharmacological profiles for 24 anticancer drugs across 479 of the cell lines, this collection allowed identification of genetic, lineage, and gene-expression-based predictors of drug sensitivity. In addition to known predictors, we found that plasma cell lineage correlated with sensitivity to IGF1 receptor inhibitors; AHR expression was associated with MEK inhibitor efficacy in NRAS-mutant lines; and SLFN11 expression predicted sensitivity to topoisomerase inhibitors. Together, our results indicate that large, annotated cell-line collections may help to enable preclinical stratification schemata for anticancer agents. The generation of genetic predictions of drug response in the preclinical setting and their incorporation into cancer clinical trial design could speed the emergence of 'personalized' therapeutic regimens.},

  abstract = {Tumor-infiltrating immune cells have been linked to prognosis and response to immunotherapy; however, the levels of distinct immune cell subsets and the signals that draw them into a tumor, such as the expression of antigen presenting machinery genes, remain poorly characterized. Here, we employ a gene expression-based computational method to profile the infiltration levels of 24 immune cell populations in 19 cancer types. We compare cancer types using an immune infiltration score and a T cell infiltration score and find that clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is among the highest for both scores. Using immune infiltration profiles as well as transcriptomic and proteomic datasets, we characterize three groups of ccRCC tumors: T cell enriched, heterogeneously infiltrated, and non-infiltrated. We observe that the immunogenicity of ccRCC tumors cannot be explained by mutation load or neo-antigen load, but is highly correlated with MHC class I antigen presenting machinery expression (APM). We explore the prognostic value of distinct T cell subsets and show in two cohorts that Th17 cells and CD8+ T/Treg ratio are associated with improved survival, whereas Th2 cells and Tregs are associated with negative outcomes. Investigation of the association of immune infiltration patterns with the subclonal architecture of tumors shows that both APM and T cell levels are negatively associated with subclone number. Our analysis sheds light on the immune infiltration patterns of 19 human cancers and unravels mRNA signatures with prognostic utility and immunotherapeutic biomarker potential in ccRCC.},

Molecularly targeted agents aim to exploit key tumor-specific vulnerabilities such as oncogenic or non-oncogenic addiction and synthetic lethality. Additionally, immunotherapies targeting the host immune system are proving to be another promising and complementary approach. Owing to substantial tumor genomic and immunologic complexities, combination strategies are likely to be required to adequately disrupt intricate molecular interactions and provide meaningful long-term benefit to patients. To optimize the therapeutic success and application of combination therapies, systematic scientific discovery will need to be coupled with novel and efficient clinical trial approaches. Indeed, a paradigm shift is required to drive precision medicine forward, from the traditional "drug-centric" model of clinical development in pursuit of small incremental benefits in large heterogeneous groups of patients, to a "strategy-centric" model to provide customized transformative treatments in molecularly stratified subsets of patients or even in individual patients. Crucially, to combat the numerous challenges facing combination drug development-including our growing but incomplete understanding of tumor biology, technical and informatics limitations, and escalating financial costs-aligned goals and multidisciplinary collaboration are imperative to collectively harness knowledge and fuel continual innovation.},

  issn = {09598049},
  abstract = {In Europe, almost 1000 children are diagnosed with a malignant renal tumour each year. The vast majority of cases are nephroblastoma, also known as Wilms' tumour (WT). Most children are treated according to Soci{\'e}t{\'e} Internationale d'Oncologie P{\'e}diatrique Renal Tumour Study Group (SIOP-RTSG) protocols with pre-operative chemotherapy, surgery, and post-operative treatment dependent on stage and histology. Overall survival approaches 90{{\%}}, but a subgroup of WT, with high-risk histology and/or relapsed disease, still have a much poorer prognosis. Outcome is similarly poor for the rare non-WT, particularly for malignant rhabdoid tumour of the kidney, metastatic clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK), and metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Improving outcome and long-term quality of life requires more accurate risk stratification through biological insights. Biomarkers are also needed to signpost potential targeted therapies for high-risk subgroups. Our understanding of Wilms' tumourigenesis is evolving and several signalling pathways, microRNA processing and epigenetics are now known to play pivotal roles. Most rhabdoid tumours display somatic and/or germline mutations in the SMARCB1 gene, whereas CCSK and paediatric RCC reveal a more varied genetic basis, including characteristic translocations. Conducting early-phase trials of targeted therapies is challenging due to the scarcity of patients with refractory or relapsed disease, the rapid progression of relapse and the genetic heterogeneity of the tumours with a low prevalence of individual somatic mutations. A further consideration in improving population survival rates is the geographical variation in outcomes across Europe. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current biological knowledge of childhood renal tumours alongside the progress achieved through international collaboration. Ongoing collaboration is needed to ensure consistency of outcomes through standardised diagnostics and treatment and incorporation of biomarker research. Together, these objectives constitute the rationale for the forthcoming SIOP-RTSG 'UMBRELLA' study.},

  title = {Hypoxia-Induced Leptin Production in Human Trophoblasts Does Not Protect from Apoptosis},
  volume = {153},
  issn = {0804-4643},
  abstract = {OBJECTIVE The ob-gene product, leptin, is an important regulator of placental and fetal development during pregnancy. Leptin, being induced by hypoxia in the placenta, is a known pro-apoptotic molecule in adipose tissue but is also known to inhibit apoptosis in other tissues like neuroblastoma cells. Based on these findings, we investigated if leptin has a pro- or anti-apoptotic effect on a trophoblastic cell line (JAr cells) in the presence or absence of oxygen. METHODS AND RESULTS Measurement of leptin in the supernatant by using ELISA showed hypoxia-induced leptin production in JAr cells in vitro. This could be confirmed by a leptin-specific RT-PCR. By analyzing leptin and/or hypoxia exposed cells with FACS cytometry we found that JAr cells can cope with hypoxia down to oxygen tensions of 1{{\%}}. At this level, only a small number of cells underwent apoptosis. Interestingly, leptin added to the culture medium in high concentrations was not able to interfere with the rate of proliferation or apoptosis in these cells independent of the oxygen tension. Finally, an anti-caspase-3 and anti-caspase-9 Western blot was performed. Again, no difference in the expression of caspase-3 and -9 under the conditions tested was seen. CONCLUSIONS These results show that leptin, produced by placental cells after hypoxia in vitro, has no influence on the rate of proliferation of these cells. Furthermore, it does not influence apoptotic pathways in the trophoblastic cell line tested under hypoxic and non-hypoxic conditions.},

Here, we identify the AKT1 kinase as a major negative regulator of the NR3C1 glucocorticoid receptor protein activity driving glucocorticoid resistance in T-ALL. Mechanistically, AKT1 impairs glucocorticoid-induced gene expression by direct phosphorylation of NR3C1 at position S134 and blocking glucocorticoid-induced NR3C1 translocation to the nucleus. Moreover, we demonstrate that loss of PTEN and consequent AKT1 activation can effectively block glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis and induce resistance to glucocorticoid therapy. Conversely, pharmacologic inhibition of AKT with MK2206 effectively restores glucocorticoid-induced NR3C1 translocation to the nucleus, increases the response of T-ALL cells to glucocorticoid therapy, and effectively reverses glucocorticoid resistance in vitro and in vivo.},

  abstract = {To assess the utility of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for analysis of MYCN gene amplification in neuroblastoma, we compared this assay with Southern blot analysis using tumor specimens collected from 232 patients with presenting characteristics typical of this disease. The FISH technique identified MYCN amplification in 47 cases, compared with 39 by Southern blotting, thus increasing the total number of positive cases by 21{{\%}}. The major cause of discordancy was a low fraction of tumor cells ({$<$} or =30{{\%}} replacement) in clinical specimens, which prevented an accurate estimate of MYCN copy number by Southern blotting. With FISH, by contrast, it was possible to analyze multiple interphase nuclei of tumor cells, regardless of the proportion of normal peripheral blood, bone marrow, or stromal cells in clinical samples. Thus, FISH could be performed accurately with very small numbers of tumor cells from touch preparations of needle biopsies. Moreover, this procedure allowed us to discern the heterogeneous pattern of MYCN amplification that is characteristic of neuroblastoma. We conclude that FISH improves the detection of MYCN gene amplification in childhood neuroblastomas in a clinical setting, thus facilitating therapeutic decisions based on the presence or absence of this prognostically important biologic marker.},

  volume = {24},
  abstract = {Background: In contrast with the decreasing incidence seen for most cancers, endometrial cancer has been increasing in the United States. We examined whether the increasing incidence and mortality from endometrial cancer are equally distributed by race/ethnicity and tumor histologic subtype. Methods: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) endometrial cancer incidence and mortality data were obtained from 2000 to 2011. Age-adjusted incidence and incidence-based mortality rates, 95{{\%}} confidence intervals, and annual percent changes (APC) were calculated. Rate ratios were calculated to compare racial/ethnic groups. Five-year relative survival rates were presented to explore survival by stage at diagnosis. Results: Incidence rates for endometrial cancers are rising across all racial/ethnic groups, with the greatest APC seen among non-Hispanic black (NHB) and Asian women (APC, 2.5 for both). NHB women have significantly higher incidence rates of aggres-sive endometrial cancers (clear cell, serous, high-grade endome-trioid, and malignant mixed Mullerian tumors) compared with non-Hispanic white (NHW) women. Hispanic and Asian women have incidence rates equal to or lower than NHW women for all tumor subtypes. For nearly every stage and subtype, the 5-year relative survival for NHB women is significantly less than NHW women, whereas Hispanic and Asian women have the same or better survival. Conclusions: Endometrial cancer incidence is increasing for all women, particularly the aggressive subtypes. The disparity asso-ciated with excess incidence for these aggressive histologic sub-types and poorer survival is limited to NHB women. Impact: Increasing rates of aggressive endometrial cancers may widen the survival disparity between NHW and NHB women.},

In comparison to other unsupervised clustering methods including K-means and hierarchical clustering, NMF has higher accuracy in separating similar groups in various datasets. We ranked genes by their importance scores (D-scores) in separating these groups, and discovered that NMF uniquely identifies genes expressed at intermediate levels as top-ranked genes. Finally, we show that in conjugation with the modularity detection method FEM, NMF reveals meaningful protein-protein interaction modules. In summary, we propose that NMF is a desirable method to analyze heterogeneous single-cell RNA-Seq data.

Here, we reveal a hierarchical mechanism in the direct conversion of fibroblasts into induced neuronal (iN) cells mediated by the transcription factors Ascl1, Brn2, and Myt1l. Ascl1 acts as an "on-target" pioneer factor by immediately occupying most cognate genomic sites in fibroblasts. In contrast, Brn2 and Myt1l do not access fibroblast chromatin productively on their own; instead, Ascl1 recruits Brn2 to Ascl1 sites genome wide. A unique trivalent chromatin signature in the host cells predicts the permissiveness for Ascl1 pioneering activity among different cell types. Finally, we identified Zfp238 as a key Ascl1 target gene that can partially substitute for Ascl1 during iN cell reprogramming. Thus, a precise match between pioneer factors and the chromatin context at key target genes is determinative for transdifferentiation to neurons and likely other cell types.},

Here we describe a strategy to address this problem that combines gene expression profiling of large numbers of single cells with data analysis based on diffusion maps for dimensionality reduction and network synthesis from state transition graphs. Applying the approach to hematopoietic development in the mouse embryo, we map the progression of mesoderm toward blood using single-cell gene expression analysis of 3,934 cells with blood-forming potential captured at four time points between E7.0 and E8.5. Transitions between individual cellular states are then used as input to develop a single-cell network synthesis toolkit to generate a computationally executable transcriptional regulatory network model of blood development. Several model predictions concerning the roles of Sox and Hox factors are validated experimentally. Our results demonstrate that single-cell analysis of a developing organ coupled with computational approaches can reveal the transcriptional programs that underpin organogenesis.},

A mesenchymal phenotype is the hallmark of tumour aggressiveness in human malignant glioma, but the regulatory programs responsible for implementing the associated molecular signature are largely unknown. Here we show that reverse-engineering and an unbiased interrogation of a glioma-specific regulatory network reveal the transcriptional module that activates expression of mesenchymal genes in malignant glioma. Two transcription factors (C/EBPbeta and STAT3) emerge as synergistic initiators and master regulators of mesenchymal transformation. Ectopic co-expression of C/EBPbeta and STAT3 reprograms neural stem cells along the aberrant mesenchymal lineage, whereas elimination of the two factors in glioma cells leads to collapse of the mesenchymal signature and reduces tumour aggressiveness. In human glioma, expression of C/EBPbeta and STAT3 correlates with mesenchymal differentiation and predicts poor clinical outcome. These results show that the activation of a small regulatory module is necessary and sufficient to initiate and maintain an aberrant phenotypic state in cancer cells.},

  volume = {11},
  issn = {1559-2294},
  abstract = {Neuroblastoma is a very heterogeneous tumor of childhood. The clinical spectra range from very aggressive metastatic disease to spontaneous regression, even without therapy. Aberrant DNA methylation pattern is a common feature of most cancers. For neuroblastoma, it has been demonstrated both for single genes as well as genome-wide, where a so-called methylator phenotype has been described. Here, we present a study using Illumina 450K methylation arrays on 60 neuroblastoma tumors. We show that aggressive tumors, characterized by International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) as stage M, are hypermethylated compared to low-grade tumors. On the contrary, INRG stage L tumors display more non-CpG methylation. The genes with the highest number of hypermethylated CpG sites in INRG M tumors are TERT, PCDHGA4, DLX5, and DLX6-AS1. Gene ontology analysis showed a representation of neuronal tumor relevant gene functions among the differentially methylated genes. For validation, we used a set of independent tumors previously analyzed with the Illumina 27K methylation arrays, which confirmed the differentially methylated sites. Top candidate genes with aberrant methylation were analyzed for altered gene expression through the R2 platform ( http://r2.amc.nl), and for correlations between methylation and gene expression in a public dataset. Altered expression in nonsurvivors was found for the genes B3GALT4 and KIAA1949, CLIC5, DLX6-AS, TERT, and PIRT, and strongest correlations were found for TRIM36, KIAA0513, and PIRT. Our data indicate that methylation profiling can be used for patient stratification and informs on epigenetically deregulated genes with the potential of increasing our knowledge about the underlying mechanisms of tumor development.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION Cell populations are never truly homogeneous; individual cells exist in biochemical states that define functional differences between them. New technology based on microfluidic arrays combined with multiplexed quantitative polymerase chain reactions now enables high-throughput single-cell gene expression measurement, allowing assessment of cellular heterogeneity. However, few analytic tools have been developed specifically for the statistical and analytical challenges of single-cell quantitative polymerase chain reactions data. RESULTS We present a statistical framework for the exploration, quality control and analysis of single-cell gene expression data from microfluidic arrays. We assess accuracy and within-sample heterogeneity of single-cell expression and develop quality control criteria to filter unreliable cell measurements. We propose a statistical model accounting for the fact that genes at the single-cell level can be on (and a continuous expression measure is recorded) or dichotomously off (and the recorded expression is zero). Based on this model, we derive a combined likelihood ratio test for differential expression that incorporates both the discrete and continuous components. Using an experiment that examines treatment-specific changes in expression, we show that this combined test is more powerful than either the continuous or dichotomous component in isolation, or a t-test on the zero-inflated data. Although developed for measurements from a specific platform (Fluidigm), these tools are generalizable to other multi-parametric measures over large numbers of events.

  title = {Inferring Synthetic Lethal Interactions from Mutual Exclusivity of Genetic Events in Cancer},
  volume = {10},
  issn = {1745-6150},
  abstract = {Synthetic lethality (SL) refers to the genetic interaction between two or more genes where only their co-alteration (e.g. by mutations, amplifications or deletions) results in cell death. In recent years, SL has emerged as an attractive therapeutic strategy against cancer: by targeting the SL partners of altered genes in cancer cells, these cells can be selectively killed while sparing the normal cells. Consequently, a number of studies have attempted prediction of SL interactions in human, a majority by extrapolating SL interactions inferred through large-scale screens in model organisms. However, these predicted SL interactions either do not hold in human cells or do not include genes that are (frequently) altered in human cancers, and are therefore not attractive in the context of cancer therapy. Here, we develop a computational approach to infer SL interactions directly from frequently altered genes in human cancers. It is based on the observation that pairs of genes that are altered in a (significantly) mutually exclusive manner in cancers are likely to constitute lethal combinations. Using genomic copy-number and gene-expression data from four cancers, breast, prostate, ovarian and uterine (total 3980 samples) from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we identify 718 genes that are frequently amplified or upregulated, and are likely to be synthetic lethal with six key DNA-damage response (DDR) genes in these cancers. By comparing with published data on gene essentiality ({{\~}}16000 genes) from ten DDR-deficient cancer cell lines, we show that our identified genes are enriched among the top quartile of essential genes in these cell lines, implying that our inferred genes are highly likely to be (synthetic) lethal upon knockdown in these cell lines. Among the inferred targets are tousled-like kinase 2 (TLK2) and the deubiquitinating enzyme ubiquitin-specific-processing protease 7 (USP7) whose overexpression correlates with poor survival in cancers. Mutual exclusivity between frequently occurring genetic events identifies synthetic lethal combinations in cancers. These identified genes are essential in cell lines, and are potential candidates for targeted cancer therapy.

ZFHX4 is required to maintain TIC-associated and normal human neural precursor cell phenotypes in vitro, suggesting that ZFHX4 regulates differentiation, and its suppression increases glioma-free survival in intracranial xenografts. ZFHX4 interacts with CHD4, a core member of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex. ZFHX4 and CHD4 bind to overlapping sets of genomic loci and control similar gene expression programs. Using expression data derived from GBM patients, we found that ZFHX4 significantly affects CHD4-mediated gene expression perturbations, which defines ZFHX4 as a master regulator of CHD4. These observations define ZFHX4 as a regulatory factor that links the chromatin-remodeling NuRD complex and the GBM TIC state.},

Recently, it has been shown that integration of external data sources (such as gene and protein sequence information, gene ontology data, protein-protein interactions) with mRNA expression profiles may increase the reliability of the inference process. Here, I propose a new approach that incorporates transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) and physical protein interactions (PPI) among transcription factors (TFs) in a Bayesian variable selection (BVS) algorithm which can infer GRNs from mRNA expression profiles subjected to genetic perturbations. Using real experimental data, I show that the integration of TFBS and PPI data with mRNA expression profiles leads to significantly more accurate networks than those inferred from expression profiles alone. Additionally, the performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with a series of least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression-based network inference methods that can also incorporate prior knowledge in the inference framework. The results of this comparison suggest that BVS can outperform LASSO regression-based method in some circumstances.},

  volume = {106},
  issn = {1091-6490},
  abstract = {The BCL6 proto-oncogene encodes a transcriptional repressor that is required for germinal center (GC) formation and whose deregulation by genomic lesions is implicated in the pathogenesis of GC-derived diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and, less frequently, follicular lymphoma (FL). The biological function of BCL6 is only partially understood because no more than a few genes have been functionally characterized as direct targets of BCL6 transrepression activity. Here we report that the anti-apoptotic proto-oncogene BCL2 is a direct target of BCL6 in GC B cells. BCL6 binds to the BCL2 promoter region by interacting with the transcriptional activator Miz1 and suppresses Miz1-induced activation of BCL2 expression. BCL6-mediated suppression of BCL2 is lost in FL and DLBCL, where the 2 proteins are pathologically coexpressed, because of BCL2 chromosomal translocations and other mechanisms, including Miz1 deregulation and somatic mutations in the BCL2 promoter region. These results identify an important function for BCL6 in facilitating apoptosis of GC B cells via suppression of BCL2, and suggest that blocking this pathway is critical for lymphomagenesis.},

Here we describe a test based on massively parallel DNA sequencing to characterize base substitutions, short insertions and deletions (indels), copy number alterations and selected fusions across 287 cancer-related genes from routine formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) clinical specimens. We implemented a practical validation strategy with reference samples of pooled cell lines that model key determinants of accuracy, including mutant allele frequency, indel length and amplitude of copy change. Test sensitivity achieved was 95-99{{\%}} across alteration types, with high specificity (positive predictive value {$>$}99{{\%}}). We confirmed accuracy using 249 FFPE cancer specimens characterized by established assays.

  abstract = {High-risk neuroblastomas show a paucity of recurrent somatic mutations at diagnosis. As a result, the molecular basis for this aggressive phenotype remains elusive. Recent progress in regulatory network analysis helped us elucidate disease-driving mechanisms downstream of genomic alterations, including recurrent chromosomal alterations. Our analysis identified three molecular subtypes of high-risk neuroblastomas, consistent with chromosomal alterations, and identified subtype-specific master regulator (MR) proteins that were conserved across independent cohorts. A 10 protein transcriptional module - centered around a TEAD4 {$\leftrightarrow$} MYCN positive-feedback loop - emerged as the regulatory driver of the high-risk subtype associated with MYCN amplification. Silencing of either gene collapsed MYCN-amplified (MYCNAmp) neuroblastoma transcriptional hallmarks and abrogated viability in vitro and in vivo. Consistently, TEAD4 emerged as a robust prognostic marker of poor survival, with activity independent of the canonical Hippo pathway transcriptional co-activators, YAP and TAZ. These results suggest novel therapeutic strategies for the large subset of MYCN deregulated neuroblastomas.},

  title = {A Network-Assisted Co-Clustering Algorithm to Discover Cancer Subtypes Based on Gene Expression.},
  volume = {15},
  issn = {1471-2105},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cancer subtype information is critically important for understanding tumor heterogeneity. Existing methods to identify cancer subtypes have primarily focused on utilizing generic clustering algorithms (such as hierarchical clustering) to identify subtypes based on gene expression data. The network-level interaction among genes, which is key to understanding the molecular perturbations in cancer, has been rarely considered during the clustering process. The motivation of our work is to develop a method that effectively incorporates molecular interaction networks into the clustering process to improve cancer subtype identification.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nRESULTS: We have developed a new clustering algorithm for cancer subtype identification, called "network-assisted co-clustering for the identification of cancer subtypes" (NCIS). NCIS combines gene network information to simultaneously group samples and genes into biologically meaningful clusters. Prior to clustering, we assign weights to genes based on their impact in the network. Then a new weighted co-clustering algorithm based on a semi-nonnegative matrix tri-factorization is applied. We evaluated the effectiveness of NCIS on simulated datasets as well as large-scale Breast Cancer and Glioblastoma Multiforme patient samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. NCIS was shown to better separate the patient samples into clinically distinct subtypes and achieve higher accuracy on the simulated datasets to tolerate noise, as compared to consensus hierarchical clustering.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nCONCLUSIONS: The weighted co-clustering approach in NCIS provides a unique solution to incorporate gene network information into the clustering process. Our tool will be useful to comprehensively identify cancer subtypes that would otherwise be obscured by cancer heterogeneity, using high-throughput and high-dimensional gene expression data.},

Our perspective is that models are developed iteratively: We build a model, use it to analyze data, assess how it succeeds and fails, revise it, and repeat. We describe how new research has transformed these essential activities. First, we describe probabilistic graphical models, a language for formulating latent variable models.

  abstract = {Neuroblastoma, a childhood cancer that originates from neural crest-derived cells, is the most common deadly solid tumor of infancy. Amplification of the MYCN oncogene, which occurs in approximately 20-25{{\%}} of human neuroblastomas, is the most prominent genetic marker of high-stage disease. The availability of valid preclinical in vivo models is a prerequisite to develop novel targeted therapies. We here report on the generation of transgenic mice with Cre-conditional induction of MYCN in dopamine {$\beta$}-hydroxylase-expressing cells, termed LSL-MYCN;Dbh-iCre. These mice develop neuroblastic tumors with an incidence of {$>$}75{{\%}}, regardless of strain background. Molecular profiling of tumors revealed upregulation of the MYCN-dependent miR-17-92 cluster as well as expression of neuroblastoma marker genes, including tyrosine hydroxylase and the neural cell adhesion molecule 1. Gene set enrichment analyses demonstrated significant correlation with MYC-associated expression patterns. Array comparative genome hybridization showed that chromosomal aberrations in LSL-MYCN;Dbh-iCre tumors were syntenic to those observed in human neuroblastomas. Treatment of a cell line established from a tumor derived from a LSL-MYCN;Dbh-iCre mouse with JQ1 or MLN8237 reduced cell viability and demonstrated oncogene addiction to MYCN. Here we report establishment of the first Cre-conditional human MYCN-driven mouse model for neuroblastoma that closely recapitulates the human disease with respect to tumor localization, histology, marker expression and genomic make up. This mouse model is a valuable tool for further functional studies and to assess the effect of targeted therapies.},

  abstract = {Treatment of high-risk childhood neuroblastoma is a clinical challenge which has been hampered by a lack of reliable neuroblastoma mouse models for preclinical drug testing. We have previously established invasive and metastasising patient-derived orthotopic xenografts (PDXs) from high-risk neuroblastomas that retained the genotypes and phenotypes of patient tumours. Given the important role of the tumour microenvironment in tumour progression, metastasis, and treatment responses, here we analysed the tumour microenvironment of five neuroblastoma PDXs in detail. The PDXs resembled their parent tumours and retained important stromal hallmarks of aggressive lesions including rich blood and lymphatic vascularisation, pericyte coverage, high numbers of cancer-associated fibroblasts, tumour-associated macrophages, and extracellular matrix components. Patient-derived tumour endothelial cells occasionally formed blood vessels in PDXs; however, tumour stroma was, overall, of murine origin. Lymphoid cells and lymphatic endothelial cells were found in athymic nude mice but not in NSG mice; thus, the choice of mouse strain dictates tumour microenvironmental components. The murine tumour microenvironment of orthotopic neuroblastoma PDXs reflects important hallmarks of aggressive and metastatic clinical neuroblastomas. Neuroblastoma PDXs are clinically relevant models for preclinical drug testing.},

  issn = {0016-6731},
  abstract = {Histone post-translational modifications play vital roles in a variety of nuclear processes, including DNA repair. It has been previously shown that histone H3K79 methylation is important for the cellular response to DNA damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) radiation, with evidence that specific methylation states play distinct roles in UV repair. Here we report that H3K79 methylation is reduced in response to UV exposure in Saccharomyces cerevisiae This reduction is specific to the dimethylated state, as trimethylation levels are minimally altered by UV exposure. Inhibition of this reduction has a deleterious effect on UV-induced sister chromatid exchange, suggesting that H3K79 dimethylation levels play a regulatory role in UV repair. Further evidence implicates an additional role for H3K79 dimethylation levels in error-free translesion synthesis, but not in UV-induced G1/S checkpoint activation or double-stranded break repair. Additionally, we find that H3K79 dimethylation levels are influenced by acetylatable lysines on the histone H4 N-terminal tail, which are hyperacetylated in response to UV exposure. Preclusion of H4 acetylation prevents UV-induced reduction of H3K79 dimethylation, and similarly has a negative effect on UV-induced sister chromatid exchange. These results point to the existence of a novel histone crosstalk pathway that is important for the regulation of UV-induced DNA damage repair.},

  issn = {1091-6490},
  abstract = {Neuroblastoma (NB) is a remarkably heterogenic childhood tumor of the sympathetic nervous system with clinical behavior ranging from spontaneous regression to poorly differentiated tumors and metastasis. MYCN is amplified in 20{{\%}} of cases and correlates with an undifferentiated, aggressive phenotype and poor prognosis. Estrogen receptor alpha (ER{$\alpha$}) and the nerve growth factor (NGF) receptors TrkA and p75NTR are involved in neuronal differentiation and survival. We have previously shown that MYCN, via miR-18a, targets ER{$\alpha$} in NB cells. Here, we demonstrate that interference with miR-18a or overexpression of ER{$\alpha$} is sufficient to induce NGF signaling and to modulate both basal and NGF-induced neuronal differentiation in MYCN-amplified NB cells. Proteomic analysis confirmed an increase of neuronal features and showed that processes linked to tumor initiation and progression were inhibited upon ER{$\alpha$} overexpression. Indeed, ectopic ER{$\alpha$} expression was sufficient to inhibit metabolic activity and tumorigenic processes, including glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, cell viability, migration, and anchorage independent growth. Importantly, ER{$\alpha$} overexpression reduced tumor burden in NB mouse models and high ER{$\alpha$} levels were linked to improved survival in patients. In addition to ER{$\alpha$}, several other nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs), including the glucocorticoid and the retinoic acid receptors, correlated with clinical markers for favorable and low-stage NB disease. Our data suggest that MYCN targets ER{$\alpha$} and thereby NGF signaling to maintain an undifferentiated and aggressive phenotype. Notably, we identified the estrogen-NGF crosstalk, as well as a set of other NHRs, as potential prognostic markers and targets for therapeutic strategies against NB.},

  abstract = {It is now clear that human neoplasms form, progress and respond to therapy in the context of an intimate crosstalk with the host immune system. In particular, accumulating evidence demonstrates that the efficacy of most, if not all, chemo- and radiotherapeutic agents commonly employed in the clinic critically depends on the (re)activation of tumor-targeting immune response. One of the mechanisms whereby conventional chemotherapeutics, targeted anticancer agents and radiotherapy can provoke a therapeutically relevant, adaptive immune response against malignant cells is commonly known as ,,immunogenic cell death`` (ICD). Importantly, dying cancer cells are perceived as immunogenic only when they emit a set of immunostimulatory signals upon the activation of intracellular stress response pathways. The emission of these signals, which are generally referred to as ,,damage-associated molecular patterns`` (DAMPs), may therefore predict whether patients will respond to chemotherapy or not, at least in some settings. Here, we review clinical data indicating that DAMPs and DAMP-associated stress responses might have prognostic or predictive value for cancer patients.},

  volume = {22},
  issn = {1088-9051},
  abstract = {Gene regulatory programs in distinct cell types are maintained in large part through the cell-type-specific binding of transcription factors (TFs). The determinants of TF binding include direct DNA sequence preferences, DNA sequence preferences of cofactors, and the local cell-dependent chromatin context. To explore the contribution of DNA sequence signal, histone modifications, and DNase accessibility to cell-type-specific binding, we analyzed 286 ChIP-seq experiments performed by the ENCODE Consortium. This analysis included experiments for 67 transcriptional regulators, 15 of which were profiled in both the GM12878 (lymphoblastoid) and K562 (erythroleukemic) human hematopoietic cell lines. To model TF-bound regions, we trained support vector machines (SVMs) that use flexible k-mer patterns to capture DNA sequence signals more accurately than traditional motif approaches. In addition, we trained SVM spatial chromatin signatures to model local histone modifications and DNase accessibility, obtaining significantly more accurate TF occupancy predictions than simpler approaches. Consistent with previous studies, we find that DNase accessibility can explain cell-line-specific binding for many factors. However, we also find that of the 10 factors with prominent cell-type-specific binding patterns, four display distinct cell-type-specific DNA sequence preferences according to our models. Moreover, for two factors we identify cell-specific binding sites that are accessible in both cell types but bound only in one. For these sites, cell-type-specific sequence models, rather than DNase accessibility, are better able to explain differential binding. Our results suggest that using a single motif for each TF and filtering for chromatin accessible loci is not always sufficient to accurately account for cell-type-specific binding profiles.},

  abstract = {Large-scale multiple testing tasks often exhibit dependence, and leveraging the dependence between individual tests is still one challenging and important problem in statistics. With recent advances in graphical models, it is feasible to use them to perform multiple testing under dependence. We propose a multiple testing procedure which is based on a Markov-random-field-coupled mixture model. The ground truth of hypotheses is represented by a latent binary Markov random-field, and the observed test statistics appear as the coupled mixture variables. The parameters in our model can be automatically learned by a novel EM algorithm. We use an MCMC algorithm to infer the posterior probability that each hypothesis is null (termed local index of significance), and the false discovery rate can be controlled accordingly. Simulations show that the numerical performance of multiple testing can be improved substantially by using our procedure. We apply the procedure to a real-world genome-wide association study on breast cancer, and we identify several SNPs with strong association evidence.},

Our ability to integrate information across platforms provided key insights into previously defined gene expression subtypes and demonstrated the existence of four main breast cancer classes when combining data from five platforms, each of which shows significant molecular heterogeneity. Somatic mutations in only three genes (TP53, PIK3CA and GATA3) occurred at {$>$}10{{\%}} incidence across all breast cancers; however, there were numerous subtype-associated and novel gene mutations including the enrichment of specific mutations in GATA3, PIK3CA and MAP3K1 with the luminal A subtype. We identified two novel protein-expression-defined subgroups, possibly produced by stromal/microenvironmental elements, and integrated analyses identified specific signalling pathways dominant in each molecular subtype including a HER2/phosphorylated HER2/EGFR/phosphorylated EGFR signature within the HER2-enriched expression subtype. Comparison of basal-like breast tumours with high-grade serous ovarian tumours showed many molecular commonalities, indicating a related aetiology and similar therapeutic opportunities. The biological finding of the four main breast cancer subtypes caused by different subsets of genetic and epigenetic abnormalities raises the hypothesis that much of the clinically observable plasticity and heterogeneity occurs within, and not across, these major biological subtypes of breast cancer.},

A range of technologies is beginning to provide information that will enable a holistic view of how genomic and epigenetic aberrations in cancer cells can alter the homeostasis of signalling networks within these cells, between cancer cells and the local microenvironment, and at the organ and organism level. This process, termed Systems Biology, needs to be integrated with an iterative approach wherein hypotheses and predictions that arise from modelling are refined and constrained by experimental evaluation. Systems biology approaches will be vital for developing and implementing effective strategies to deliver personalized cancer therapy. Specifically, these approaches will be important to select those patients who are most likely to benefit from targeted therapies and for the development and implementation of rational combinatorial therapies. Systems biology can help to increase therapy efficacy or bypass the emergence of resistance, thus converting the current-often short term-effects of targeted therapies into durable responses, ultimately to improve patient quality of life and provide a cure.},

  abstract = {Molecular heterogeneity of cancer, partially caused by various chromosomal aberrations or gene mutations, can yield substantial heterogeneity in gene expression profile in cancer samples. To detect cancer-related genes which are active only in a subset of cancer samples or cancer outliers, several methods have been proposed in the context of multiple testing. Such cancer outlier analyses will generally suffer from a serious lack of power, compared with the standard multiple testing setting where common activation of genes across all cancer samples is supposed. In this paper, we consider information sharing across genes and cancer samples, via a parametric normal mixture modeling of gene expression levels of cancer samples across genes after a standardization using the reference, normal sample data. A gene-based statistic for gene selection is developed on the basis of a posterior probability of cancer outlier for each cancer sample. Some efficiency improvement by using our method was demonstrated, even under settings with misspecified, heavy-tailed t-distributions. An application to a real dataset from hematologic malignancies is provided.},

The nervous system is a component of every organ system of the body, and therefore, is invariably at the front line of the tumor invasion. Due to the complexity of the nervous system physiology, this review separately discusses the contributions of the central and peripheral nervous systems to the tumorigenesis and tumor progression. We further focus the discussion on the evidence that Schwann cells aid in tumor growth and invasion. Schwann cells, a largely unexplored element of the tumor microenvironment, may participate in the creation of tumor-favorable conditions through both bi-directional interaction with cancer cells and the facilitation of the immune-suppressive microenvironment through the mechanism of neural repair and immunomodulation.},

The historical basis for predicting the effect of a combination is based on the concept of dose equivalence; i.e., an equally effective dose (a) of one will add to the dose (b) of the other in the combination situation. For drugs with a constant relative potency, this leads to linear additive isoboles (a-b curves of constant effect), whereas a varying potency ratio produces nonlinear additive isoboles. Determination of the additive isobole is a necessary procedure for assessing both synergistic and antagonistic interactions of the combination.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Race-based survival in children and adolescents with hematologic malignancies has been a national challenge for decades. Large-scale investigations of age- and race-based survival trends over time in these patients have not previously been reported. The objective of this study was to investigate whether race- and age-related differences in pediatric and adolescent and young adult (AYA) leukemia and lymphoma survival persist and to what extent these differences have changed over time. METHODS Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, this study investigated the outcomes of black and white (1975-2012; n = 27,369) and white and Hispanic (1992-2012; n = 20,574) children (0-14 years old) and AYAs (15-39 years old) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Estimates of 5- and 10-year relative survival were compared over time. RESULTS Trends showed a convergence of survival for white and black children with ALL but a divergence in survival for AYA patients. Hispanic children and AYAs both suffered inferior outcomes. Trends for AML revealed persistent survival differences between black and white children and suggested worsening disparities for AYAs. Survival trends in HL revealed sustained survival differences between black and white AYA patients, whereas no differences were found in Hispanic and white patient outcomes for AML or HL. CONCLUSIONS Although survival for children and AYAs with ALL, AML, and HL has improved over the past 4 decades, differences persist between black, white, and Hispanic children and AYAs; survival disparities between black and white children with ALL have been nearly eliminated.

  volume = {12},
  issn = {1932-6203},
  abstract = {Hyperactivation of the phosphatydil-inositol-3' phosphate kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway is observed in most NSCLCs, promoting proliferation, migration, invasion and resistance to therapy. AKT can be activated through several mechanisms that include loss of the negative regulator PTEN, activating mutations of the catalytic subunit of PI3K (PIK3CA) and/or mutations of AKT1 itself. However, number and identity of downstream targets of activated PI3K/AKT pathway are poorly defined. To identify the genes that are targets of constitutive PI3K/AKT signalling in lung cancer cells, we performed a comparative transcriptomic analysis of human lung epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) expressing active mutant AKT1 (AKT1-E17K), active mutant PIK3CA (PIK3CA-E545K) or that are silenced for PTEN. We found that, altogether, aberrant PI3K/AKT signalling in lung epithelial cells regulated the expression of 1,960/20,436 genes (9{{\%}}), though only 30 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (15 up-regulated, 12 down-regulated and 3 discordant) out of 20,436 that were common among BEAS-AKT1-E17K, BEAS-PIK3CA-E545K and BEAS-shPTEN cells (0.1{{\%}}). Conversely, DEGs specific for mutant AKT1 were 133 (85 up-regulated; 48 down-regulated), DEGs specific for mutant PIK3CA were 502 (280 up-regulated; 222 down-regulated) and DEGs specific for PTEN loss were 1549 (799 up-regulated, 750 down-regulated). The results obtained from array analysis were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR on selected up- and down-regulated genes (n = 10). Treatment of BEAS-C cells and the corresponding derivatives with pharmacological inhibitors of AKT (MK2206) or PI3K (LY294002) further validated the significance of our findings. Moreover, mRNA expression of selected DEGs (SGK1, IGFBP3, PEG10, GDF15, PTGES, S100P, respectively) correlated with the activation status of the PI3K/AKT pathway assessed by S473 phosphorylation in NSCLC cell lines (n = 6). Finally, we made use of Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to investigate the relevant BioFunctions enriched by the costitutive activation of AKT1-, PI3K- or PTEN-dependent signalling in lung epithelial cells. Expectedly, the analysis of the DEGs common to all three alterations highlighted a group of BioFunctions that included Cell Proliferation of tumor cell lines (14 DEGs), Invasion of cells (10 DEGs) and Migration of tumour cell lines (10 DEGs), with a common core of 5 genes (ATF3, CDKN1A, GDF15, HBEGF and LCN2) that likely represent downstream effectors of the pro-oncogenic activities of PI3K/AKT signalling. Conversely, IPA analysis of exclusive DEGs led to the identification of different downstream effectors that are modulated by mutant AKT1 (TGFBR2, CTSZ, EMP1), mutant PIK3CA (CCND2, CDK2, IGFBP2, TRIB1) and PTEN loss (ASNS, FHL2). These findings not only shed light on the molecular mechanisms that are activated by aberrant signalling through the PI3K/AKT pathway in lung epithelial cells, but also contribute to the identification of previously unrecognised molecules whose regulation takes part in the development of lung cancer.},

  volume = {14},
  issn = {1471-2105},
  abstract = {Time course data from microarrays and high-throughput sequencing experiments require simple, computationally efficient and powerful statistical models to extract meaningful biological signal, and for tasks such as data fusion and clustering. Existing methodologies fail to capture either the temporal or replicated nature of the experiments, and often impose constraints on the data collection process, such as regularly spaced samples, or similar sampling schema across replications. We propose hierarchical Gaussian processes as a general model of gene expression time-series, with application to a variety of problems. In particular, we illustrate the method's capacity for missing data imputation, data fusion and clustering.The method can impute data which is missing both systematically and at random: in a hold-out test on real data, performance is significantly better than commonly used imputation methods. The method's ability to model inter- and intra-cluster variance leads to more biologically meaningful clusters. The approach removes the necessity for evenly spaced samples, an advantage illustrated on a developmental Drosophila dataset with irregular replications. The hierarchical Gaussian process model provides an excellent statistical basis for several gene-expression time-series tasks. It has only a few additional parameters over a regular GP, has negligible additional complexity, is easily implemented and can be integrated into several existing algorithms.

Recent studies suggest that in addition to neutrophil apoptosis, resolution of neutrophil inflammation at wounds can be mediated by reverse migration from tissues and transmigration back into the vasculature. In settings of chronic inflammation, neutrophils persist in tissues, and this persistence has been associated with cancer progression. However, the role of neutrophils in the tumor microenvironment remains controversial, with evidence for both pro- and anti-tumor roles. Here we review the mechanisms that regulate neutrophil recruitment and resolution at sites of tissue damage, with a specific focus on the tumor microenvironment.

While most ERVs are relics of ancient integration events, ''young'' proviruses competent for retro-transposition\textemdash{}found in many mammals, but not humans\textemdash{}represent an ongoing threat to host fitness. As a consequence, several restriction pathways have evolved to suppress their activity at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional stages of the viral life cycle. Nevertheless, accumulating evidence has revealed that LTR sequences derived from distantly related ERVs have been exapted as regulatory sequences for many host genes in a wide range of cell types throughout mammalian evolution. Here, we focus on emerging themes from recent studies cataloging the diversity of ERV LTRs acting as important transcriptional regulatory ele-ments in mammals and explore the molecular features that likely account for LTR exaptation in develop-mental and tissue-specific gene regulation. Introduction Retrotransposons, which replicate via a transcription and reverse-transcription ''copy-and-paste'' mechanism, account for greater than 40{{\%}} of the human and mouse genomes (Venter et al., 2001; Waterston et al., 2002). These parasitic sequences can be classified into two major groups. Those lacking long terminal re-peats (LTRs), including long and short interspersed nuclear ele-ments (LINEs and SINEs, respectively) and SINE variable-number tandem-repeat Alu (SVA) elements, comprise 30{{\%}}\textendash{}35{{\%}} of the genome, while those with LTRs, termed endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) or LTR retrotransposons, comprise 8{{\%}} and 10{{\%}} of the human and mouse genomes, respectively (Cordaux and Bat-zer, 2009; Friedli and Trono, 2015; Stocking and Kozak, 2008) (Figure 1A). ERVs are the descendants of exogenous retroviruses that integrated into the genome of germ cells. Most subsequently lost the ability to exit the host cell. Thus, those ERVs that may be defective for infection but are still competent for retrotransposition expand in their host genome by vertical transmission (Mager and Stoye, 2015; Magiorkinis et al., 2012).

Analysis of cellular perturbation profiles identified established MoA proteins for 70{{\%}} of the tested compounds and elucidated novel proteins that were experimentally validated.

With this increase in long-term survivorship, long-term neurocognitive side effects have emerged. Research has shown that these survivors suffer a variety of neurocognitive effects including changes in attention span, concentration, school performance and executive functioning. Researchers continue to study changes in therapy with the hopes of decreasing these long-term side effects without compromising overall survival rates. Others have focused on developing adaptations to how these children learn, equipping them with tools to better cope with learning deficits. Still, others have looked into pharmacological interventions. This chapter will discuss the historical course of therapy for both leukemia and brain tumors. In addition, it will highlight how late effect studies guided changes in therapeutic approach for both childhood leukemias and brain tumors. This chapter will also discuss specific neurocognitive effects from childhood cancer treatment, challenges in research methodologies as well as current pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions for affected childhood cancer survivors.},

  title = {Effective Filtering Strategies to Improve Data Quality from Population-Based Whole Exome Sequencing Studies},
  volume = {15},
  issn = {1471-2105},
  abstract = {Genotypes generated in next generation sequencing studies contain errors which can significantly impact the power to detect signals in common and rare variant association tests. These genotyping errors are not explicitly filtered by the standard GATK Variant Quality Score Recalibration (VQSR) tool and thus remain a source of errors in whole exome sequencing (WES) projects that follow GATK's recommended best practices. Therefore, additional data filtering methods are required to effectively remove these errors before performing association analyses with complex phenotypes. Here we empirically derive thresholds for genotype and variant filters that, when used in conjunction with the VQSR tool, achieve higher data quality than when using VQSR alone. The detailed filtering strategies improve the concordance of sequenced genotypes with array genotypes from 99.33{{\%}} to 99.77{{\%}}; improve the percent of discordant genotypes removed from 10.5{{\%}} to 69.5{{\%}}; and improve the Ti/Tv ratio from 2.63 to 2.75. We also demonstrate that managing batch effects by separating samples based on different target capture and sequencing chemistry protocols results in a final data set containing 40.9{{\%}} more high-quality variants. In addition, imputation is an important component of WES studies and is used to estimate common variant genotypes to generate additional markers for association analyses. As such, we demonstrate filtering methods for imputed data that improve genotype concordance from 79.3{{\%}} to 99.8{{\%}} while removing 99.5{{\%}} of discordant genotypes. The described filtering methods are advantageous for large population-based WES studies designed to identify common and rare variation associated with complex diseases. Compared to data processed through standard practices, these strategies result in substantially higher quality data for common and rare association analyses.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in immuno-oncology have shown that the immune system can be activated to induce long-term, durable antitumor responses. For immuno-oncology drug development, immune activation is often explored using rat Abs in immunocompetent mouse models. Although these models can be used to show efficacy, antidrug immune responses to experimental protein-based therapeutics can arise. Immunogenicity of surrogate Abs may therefore represent an important obstacle to the evaluation of the antitumor efficacy of immunomodulator Abs in syngeneic models. A recent publication has shown that anti-glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein agonistic Ab DTA-1 (rat or murinized IgG2a) can induce the development of anaphylaxis in C57BL/6 mice upon repeated i.p. dosing because of an anti-idiotypic anti-drug Ab immune response. This study was undertaken to address the impact of the immunogenicity derived from the Fc and variable domains. To this end, chimerized (rat V domains/mouse constant regions) and murinized (95{{\%}} mouse sequence) DTA-1-based surrogate Abs with a murine IgG2c H chain isotype were created. Chimerization and murinization of DTA-1 did not affect receptor binding and glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein-induced T cell agonistic properties. Similar in vivo antitumor efficacy and intratumoral CD8+/regulatory T cells were also observed. Finally, treatment of C57BL/6 mice with the chimerized and murinized DTA-1 Abs on a C57BL/6-matched IgG2c isotype resulted in reduced development and severity of anaphylaxis as measured by decline of body temperature, behavioral effects, serum IL-4, IgE, and anti-drug Ab levels. These results suggest that careful murinization and selection of a strain-matched H chain isotype are critical to generate ideal surrogate Abs for testing immuno-oncology mechanisms in vivo.},

  abstract = {Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumour occurring in childhood and has a diverse clinical presentation and course depending on the tumour biology. Unique features of these neuroendocrine tumours are the early age of onset, the high frequency of metastatic disease at diagnosis and the tendency for spontaneous regression of tumours in infancy. The most malignant tumours have amplification of the MYCN oncogene (encoding a transcription factor), which is usually associated with poor survival, even in localized disease. Although transgenic mouse models have shown that MYCN overexpression can be a tumour-initiating factor, many other cooperating genes and tumour suppressor genes are still under investigation and might also have a role in tumour development. Segmental chromosome alterations are frequent in neuroblastoma and are associated with worse outcome. The rare familial neuroblastomas are usually associated with germline mutations in ALK, which is mutated in 10-15{{\%}} of primary tumours, and provides a potential therapeutic target. Risk-stratified therapy has facilitated the reduction of therapy for children with low-risk and intermediate-risk disease. Advances in therapy for patients with high-risk disease include intensive induction chemotherapy and myeloablative chemotherapy, followed by the treatment of minimal residual disease using differentiation therapy and immunotherapy; these have improved 5-year overall survival to 50{{\%}}. Currently, new approaches targeting the noradrenaline transporter, genetic pathways and the tumour microenvironment hold promise for further improvements in survival and long-term quality of life.},

  abstract = {Pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is a neoplastic syndrome characterized by peritoneal tumor implants with copious mucinous ascites. The standard of care for PMP patients is aggressive cytoreductive surgery performed in conjunction with heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy. Not all patients are candidates for these procedures and a majority of the patients will have recurrent disease. In addition to secreted mucin, inflammation and fibrosis are central to PMP pathogenesis but the molecular processes that regulate tumor-stromal interactions within the peritoneal tumor microenvironment remain largely unknown. This knowledge is critical not only to elucidate PMP pathobiology but also to identify novel targets for therapy. Here, we report the generation of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models for PMP and assess the ability of these models to replicate the inflammatory peritoneal microenvironment of human PMP patients. PDX mouse models of low- and high-grade PMP were generated and were of a similar histopathology as human PMP. Cytokines previously shown to be elevated in human PMP were also elevated in PDX ascites. Significant differences in IL-6 and IL-8/KC/MIP2 were seen between human and PDX ascites. Interestingly, these cytokines were mostly secreted by mouse-derived, tumor-associated stromal cells rather than by human-derived PMP tumor cells. Our data suggest that the PMP PDX mouse models are especially suited to the study of tumor-stromal interactions that regulate the peritoneal inflammatory environment in PMP as the tumor and stromal cells in these mouse models are of human and murine origins, respectively. These mouse models are therefore, likely to be useful in vivo surrogates for testing and developing novel therapeutic treatment interventions for PMP.},

  abstract = {Amplification of the MYCN oncogene, a member of the MYC family of transcriptional regulators, is one of the most powerful prognostic markers identified for poor outcome in neuroblastoma, the most common extracranial solid cancer in childhood. While MYCN has been established as a key driver of malignancy in neuroblastoma, the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Transcription factor activating enhancer binding protein-4 (TFAP4) has been reported to be a direct transcriptional target of MYC. We show for the first time that high expression of TFAP4 in primary neuroblastoma patients is associated with poor clinical outcome. siRNA-mediated suppression of TFAP4 in MYCN-expressing neuroblastoma cells led to inhibition of cell proliferation and migration. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that TFAP4 expression is positively regulated by MYCN. Microarray analysis identified genes regulated by both MYCN and TFAP4 in neuroblastoma cells, including Phosphoribosyl-pyrophosphate synthetase-2 (PRPS2) and Syndecan-1 (SDC1), which are involved in cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. Overall this study suggests a regulatory circuit in which MYCN by elevating TFAP4 expression, cooperates with it to control a specific set of genes involved in tumor progression. These findings highlight the existence of a MYCN-TFAP4 axis in MYCN-driven neuroblastoma as well as identifying potential therapeutic targets for aggressive forms of this disease.},

  abstract = {In neuroblastoma, the most common solid tumor of childhood, excellent prognosis is associated with extensive Schwann cell (SC) content and high-level expression of the neurotrophin receptor, NTRK1/TrkA, which is known to mediate neuroblastoma cell differentiation. We hypothesized that both stromal composition and neuroblastic differentiation are based on bidirectional neuroblastoma-SC interaction. Reanalysis of microarray data from human SY5Y neuroblastoma cells stably transfected with either NTRK1 or NTRK2 revealed upregulation of the mRNA for the SC growth factor, NRG1, in NTRK1-positive cells. Media conditioned by NTRK1-expressing neuroblastoma cells induced SC proliferation and migration, while antibody-based NRG1 neutralization significantly decreased these effects. Vice versa, NRG1-stimulated SC secreted the NTRK1-specific ligand, NGF. SC-conditioned medium activated the NTRK1 receptor in a neuroblastoma cell culture model conditionally expressing NTRK1 and induced differentiation markers in NTRK1-expressing cells. NTRK1 induction in neuroblastoma xenografts mixed with primary SC also significantly reduced tumor growth in vivo. We propose a model for NTRK1-mediated and NRG1-dependent attraction of adjacent SC, which in turn induce neuroblastic differentiation by secretion of the NTRK1-specific ligand, NGF. These findings have implications for understanding the mature and less malignant neuroblastoma phenotype associated with NTRK1 expression, and could assist the development of new therapeutic strategies for neuroblastoma differentiation.},

When used to dissect the regulation of MYC activity in human B lymphocytes, the approach inferred novel modulators of MYC function, which act by distinct mechanisms, including protein turnover, transcription complex formation and selective enzyme recruitment. MINDy is generally applicable to study the post-translational modulation of mammalian TFs in any cellular context. As such it can be used to dissect context-specific signaling pathways and combinatorial transcriptional regulation.},

  abstract = {During the past decade, cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been increasingly identified in many malignancies. Although the origin and plasticity of these cells remain controversial, tumour heterogeneity and the presence of small populations of cells with stem-like characteristics is established in most malignancies. CSCs display many features of embryonic or tissue stem cells, and typically demonstrate persistent activation of one or more highly conserved signal transduction pathways involved in development and tissue homeostasis, including the Notch, Hedgehog (HH), and Wnt pathways. CSCs generally have slow growth rates and are resistant to chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Thus, new treatment strategies targeting these pathways to control stem-cell replication, survival and differentiation are under development. Herein, we provide an update on the latest advances in the clinical development of such approaches, and discuss strategies for overcoming CSC-associated primary or acquired resistance to cancer treatment. Given the crosstalk between the different embryonic developmental signalling pathways, as well as other pathways, designing clinical trials that target CSCs with rational combinations of agents to inhibit possible compensatory escape mechanisms could be of particular importance. We also share our views on the future directions for targeting CSCs to advance the clinical development of these classes of agents.},

  abstract = {The capacity of highly parallel sequencing technologies to detect small RNAs at unprecedented depth suggests their value in systematically identifying microRNAs (miRNAs). However, the identification of miRNAs from the large pool of sequenced transcripts from a single deep sequencing run remains a major challenge. Here, we present an algorithm, miRDeep, which uses a probabilistic model of miRNA biogenesis to score compatibility of the position and frequency of sequenced RNA with the secondary structure of the miRNA precursor. We demonstrate its accuracy and robustness using published Caenorhabditis elegans data and data we generated by deep sequencing human and dog RNAs. miRDeep reports altogether approximately 230 previously unannotated miRNAs, of which four novel C. elegans miRNAs are validated by northern blot analysis.},

A database of drug-associated gene expression profiles was screened for molecules whose profile overlapped with a gene expression signature of glucocorticoid (GC) sensitivity/resistance in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. The screen indicated that the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin profile matched the signature of GC sensitivity. We tested the hypothesis that rapamycin would induce GC sensitivity in lymphoid malignancy cells and found that it sensitized to GC-induced apoptosis via modulation of antiapoptotic MCL1. These data indicate that MCL1 is an important regulator of GC-induced apoptosis and that the combination of rapamycin and glucocorticoids has potential utility in lymphoid malignancies. Furthermore, this approach represents a strategy for identification of promising combination therapies for cancer.},

We propose a framework for the systematic discovery of genetic alterations that are causal determinants of disease, by prioritizing genes upstream of functional disease drivers, within regulatory networks inferred de novo from experimental data. We tested this framework by identifying the genetic determinants of the mesenchymal subtype of glioblastoma. Our analysis uncovered KLHL9 deletions as upstream activators of two previously established master regulators of the subtype, C/EBP{$\beta$} and C/EBP{$\delta$}. Rescue of KLHL9 expression induced proteasomal degradation of C/EBP proteins, abrogated the mesenchymal signature, and reduced tumor viability in vitro and in vivo. Deletions of KLHL9 were confirmed in {$>$} 50{{\%}} of mesenchymal cases in an independent cohort, thus representing the most frequent genetic determinant of the subtype. The method generalized to study other human diseases, including breast cancer and Alzheimer's disease.},

  volume = {30},
  issn = {1367-4803},
  abstract = {MOTIVATION To date, gene set analysis approaches primarily focus on identifying differentially expressed gene sets (pathways). Methods for identifying differentially coexpressed pathways also exist but are mostly based on aggregated pairwise correlations or other pairwise measures of coexpression. Instead, we propose Gene Sets Net Correlations Analysis (GSNCA), a multivariate differential coexpression test that accounts for the complete correlation structure between genes. RESULTS In GSNCA, weight factors are assigned to genes in proportion to the genes' cross-correlations (intergene correlations). The problem of finding the weight vectors is formulated as an eigenvector problem with a unique solution. GSNCA tests the null hypothesis that for a gene set there is no difference in the weight vectors of the genes between two conditions. In simulation studies and the analyses of experimental data, we demonstrate that GSNCA captures changes in the structure of genes' cross-correlations rather than differences in the averaged pairwise correlations. Thus, GSNCA infers differences in coexpression networks, however, bypassing method-dependent steps of network inference. As an additional result from GSNCA, we define hub genes as genes with the largest weights and show that these genes correspond frequently to major and specific pathway regulators, as well as to genes that are most affected by the biological difference between two conditions. In summary, GSNCA is a new approach for the analysis of differentially coexpressed pathways that also evaluates the importance of the genes in the pathways, thus providing unique information that may result in the generation of novel biological hypotheses. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION Implementation of the GSNCA test in R is available upon request from the authors.},

This review summarizes the present findings about ES cancer stem cell (CSC) targeted therapy: prognostic factors, chromosomal translocations, initiation, epigenetic mechanisms, candidate cell of ES origin (Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and Neural crest stem cells (NCSCs)). The ES CSC model, histopathogenesis, histogenesis, pathogenesis, ES mediated Hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs) senescence are also discussed. ESFTs therapy is reviewed concerning CSCs, radiotherapy, risk of subsequent neoplasms, stem cell (SC) support, promising therapeutic targets for ES CSCs (CSC markers, immune targeting, RNAi phenotyping screens, proposed new drugs), candidate EWS-FLI1 target genes and further directions (including human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)). Bone marrow-derived human MSCs are permissive for EWS-FLI1 expression with transition to ESFT-like cellular phenotype. ESFTs are genetically related to NCSC, permissive for EWS-FLI1 expression and susceptible to oncogene-induced immortalization. Primitive neuroectodermal features and MSC origin of ESFTs provide a basis of immune targeting. The microRNAs profile of ES CSCs is shared by ESCs and CSCs from divergent tumor types. Successful reprogramming of differentiated human somatic cells into a pluripotent state allows creation of patient- and disease-specific SCs. The functional role of endogenous EWS at stem cell level on both senescence and tumorigenesis is a link between cancer and aging. The regulatory mechanisms of oncogenic activity of EWS fusions could provide new prognostic biomarkers, therapeutic opportunities and tumor-specific anticancer agents against ESFTs.},

  abstract = {METHOD Genome-wide expression profiling is a widely used approach for characterizing heterogeneous populations of cells, tissues, biopsies, or other biological specimen. The exploratory analysis of such data typically relies on generic unsupervised methods, e.g. principal component analysis (PCA) or hierarchical clustering. However, generic methods fail to exploit prior knowledge about the molecular functions of genes. Here, I introduce GO-PCA, an unsupervised method that combines PCA with nonparametric GO enrichment analysis, in order to systematically search for sets of genes that are both strongly correlated and closely functionally related. These gene sets are then used to automatically generate expression signatures with functional labels, which collectively aim to provide a readily interpretable representation of biologically relevant similarities and differences. The robustness of the results obtained can be assessed by bootstrapping. RESULTS I first applied GO-PCA to datasets containing diverse hematopoietic cell types from human and mouse, respectively. In both cases, GO-PCA generated a small number of signatures that represented the majority of lineages present, and whose labels reflected their respective biological characteristics. I then applied GO-PCA to human glioblastoma (GBM) data, and recovered signatures associated with four out of five previously defined GBM subtypes. My results demonstrate that GO-PCA is a powerful and versatile exploratory method that reduces an expression matrix containing thousands of genes to a much smaller set of interpretable signatures. In this way, GO-PCA aims to facilitate hypothesis generation, design of further analyses, and functional comparisons across datasets.},

  abstract = {Despite advances in multimodal treatment, neuroblastoma (NB) is often fatal for children with high-risk disease and many survivors need to cope with long-term side effects from high-dose chemotherapy and radiation. To identify new therapeutic targets, we performed an siRNA screen of the druggable genome combined with a small molecule screen of 465 compounds targeting 39 different mechanisms of actions in four NB cell lines. We identified 58 genes as targets, including AURKB, in at least one cell line. In the drug screen, aurora kinase inhibitors (nine molecules) and in particular the AURKB-selective compound, barasertib, were the most discriminatory with regard to sensitivity for MYCN-amplified cell lines. In an expanded panel of ten NB cell lines, those with MYCN-amplification and wild-type TP53 were the most sensitive to low nanomolar concentrations of barasertib. Inhibition of the AURKB kinase activity resulted in decreased phosphorylation of the known target, histone H3, and upregulation of TP53 in MYCN-amplified, TP53 wild-type cells. However, both wild-type and TP53 mutant MYCN-amplified cell lines arrested in G2/M phase upon AURKB inhibition. Additionally, barasertib induced endoreduplication and apoptosis. Treatment of MYCN-amplified/TP53 wild-type neuroblastoma xenografts resulted in profound growth inhibition and tumor regression. Therefore, aurora B kinase inhibition is highly effective in aggressive neuroblastoma and warrants further investigation in clinical trials.},

  abstract = {A protocol is described for sequencing the transcriptome of a cell nucleus. Nuclei are isolated from specimens and sorted by FACS, cDNA libraries are constructed and RNA-seq is performed, followed by data analysis. Some steps follow published methods (Smart-seq2 for cDNA synthesis and Nextera XT barcoded library preparation) and are not described in detail here. Previous single-cell approaches for RNA-seq from tissues include cell dissociation using protease treatment at 30 \textdegree{}C, which is known to alter the transcriptome. We isolate nuclei at 4 \textdegree{}C from tissue homogenates, which cause minimal damage. Nuclear transcriptomes can be obtained from postmortem human brain tissue stored at -80 \textdegree{}C, making brain archives accessible for RNA-seq from individual neurons. The method also allows investigation of biological features unique to nuclei, such as enrichment of certain transcripts and precursors of some noncoding RNAs. By following this procedure, it takes about 4 d to construct cDNA libraries that are ready for sequencing.},

Single-cell genomics is opening up new ways to tackle these questions by combining the comprehensive nature of genomics with the microscopic resolution that is required to describe complex multicellular systems. Initial single-cell genomic studies provided a remarkably rich phenomenology of heterogeneous cellular states, but transforming observational studies into models of dynamics and causal mechanisms in tissues poses fresh challenges and requires stronger integration of theoretical, computational and experimental frameworks.},

Whole-genome expression profiling offers promise in this regard, but can be complicated by the challenge of identifying the genes affected by a condition from the hundreds to thousands of genes that exhibit changes in expression. Here, we show that reverse-engineered gene networks can be combined with expression profiles to compute the likelihood that genes and associated pathways are mediators of a disease. We apply our method to non-recurrent primary and metastatic prostate cancer data, and identify the androgen receptor gene (AR) among the top genetic mediators and the AR pathway as a highly enriched pathway for metastatic prostate cancer. These results were not obtained on the basis of expression change alone. We further demonstrate that the AR gene, in the context of the network, can be used as a marker to detect the aggressiveness of primary prostate cancers. This work shows that a network biology approach can be used advantageously to identify the genetic mediators and mediating pathways associated with a disease.},

  title = {Conservation of Immune Gene Signatures in Solid Tumors and Prognostic Implications},
  volume = {16},
  issn = {1471-2407},
  abstract = {Tumor-infiltrating leukocytes can either limit cancer growth or facilitate its spread. Diagnostic strategies that comprehensively assess the functional complexity of tumor immune infiltrates could have wide-reaching clinical value. In previous work we identified distinct immune gene signatures in breast tumors that reflect the relative abundance of infiltrating immune cells and exhibited significant associations with patient outcomes. Here we hypothesized that immune gene signatures agnostic to tumor type can be identified by de novo discovery of gene clusters enriched for immunological functions and possessing internal correlation structure conserved across solid tumors from different anatomic sites. We assembled microarray expression datasets encompassing 5,295 tumors of the breast, colon, lung, ovarian and prostate. Unsupervised clustering methods were used to determine number and composition of gene clusters within each dataset. Immune-enriched gene clusters (signatures) identified by gene ontology enrichment were analyzed for internal correlation structure and conservation across tumors then compared against expression profiles of: 1) flow-sorted leukocytes from peripheral blood and 2) {$>$}300 cancer cell lines from solid and hematologic cancers. Cox regression analysis was used to identify signatures with significant associations with clinical outcome. We identified nine distinct immune-enriched gene signatures conserved across all five tumor types. The signatures differentiated specific leukocyte lineages with moderate discernment overall, and naturally organized into six discrete groups indicative of admixed lineages. Moreover, seven of the signatures exhibit minimal and uncorrelated expression in cancer cell lines, suggesting that these signatures derive predominantly from infiltrating immune cells. All nine immune signatures achieved statistically significant associations with patient prognosis (p{$<$}0.05) in one or more tumor types with greatest significance observed in breast and skin cancers. Several signatures indicative of myeloid lineages exhibited poor outcome associations that were most apparent in brain and colon cancers. These findings suggest that tumor infiltrating immune cells can be differentiated by immune-specific gene expression patterns that quantify the relative abundance of multiple immune infiltrates across a range of solid tumor types. That these markers of immune involvement are significantly associated with patient prognosis in diverse cancers suggests their clinical utility as pan-cancer markers of tumor behavior and immune responsiveness.},

However, the effects of potential confounding factors, such as the cell cycle, on the heterogeneity of gene expression and therefore on the ability to robustly identify subpopulations remain unclear. We present and validate a computational approach that uses latent variable models to account for such hidden factors. We show that our single-cell latent variable model (scLVM) allows the identification of otherwise undetectable subpopulations of cells that correspond to different stages during the differentiation of naive T cells into T helper 2 cells. Our approach can be used not only to identify cellular subpopulations but also to tease apart different sources of gene expression heterogeneity in single-cell transcriptomes.},

However, recent advances in our understanding of pediatric HGG, including the application of next-generation sequencing and DNA methylation profiling, have identified mutations in the histone variant H3.3 and canonical H3.1 genes, respectively. These mutations are relatively specific to neuroanatomic compartments (cortex, midline structures, thalamus, brainstem) and are often associated with other mutations, especially in specific growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases. Targeting epigenetic pathways affected by these histone mutations, alone or in combination with small molecule inhibitors of growth factor receptor signaling pathways, will inform new treatment strategies for pediatric HGG and should be incorporated into novel cooperative group clinical trial designs.},

Three further epigenetic subgroups were enriched for hallmark genetic events of adult GBM and/or established transcriptomic signatures.

Recently, many researchers discovered that oncogenes may be activated in some but not all samples in a given disease group. The existing statistical tools for detecting differentially expressed genes in a subset of the disease group mainly include cancer outlier profile analysis (COPA), outlier sum (OS), outlier robust t-statistic (ORT) and maximum ordered subset t-statistics (MOST). In this study, another approach named Least Sum of Ordered Subset Square t-statistic (LSOSS) is proposed. The results of our simulation studies indicated that LSOSS often has more power than previous statistical methods. When applied to real human breast and prostate cancer data sets, LSOSS was competitive in terms of the biological relevance of top ranked genes. Furthermore, a modified hierarchical clustering method was developed to classify the heterogeneous gene activation patterns of human breast cancer samples based on the significant genes detected by LSOSS. Three classes of gene activation patterns, which correspond to estrogen receptor (ER)+, ER- and a mixture of ER+ and ER-, were detected and each class was assigned a different gene signature.},

Although standard chemotherapy has significantly improved long-term survival over the past few decades, the outcome for patients with metastatic or recurrent OS remains dramatically poor. Novel therapies are therefore required to slow progression and eradicate the disease. Furthermore, to better understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for OS onset and progression, the development of novel predictive culture systems resembling the native three-dimensional (3D) tumor microenvironment are mandatory. 'Tumor engineering' approaches radically changed the previous scenario, through the development of advanced and alternative 3D cell culture in vitro models able to tightly mimic the in vivo tumor microenvironment.In this review, we will summarize the state of the art in this novel area, illustrating the different methods and techniques employed to realize 3D OS cell culture models and we report the achieved results, which highlight the efficacy of these models in reproducing the tumor milieu. Although data need to be further validated, the scientific studies reviewed here are certainly promising and give new insights into the clinical practice.},

In this paper, we describe a predictive modeling approach for studying regulatory networks, based on a machine learning algorithm called MEDUSA. MEDUSA integrates promoter sequence, mRNA expression, and transcription factor occupancy data to learn gene regulatory programs that predict the differential expression of target genes. Instead of using clustering or correlation of expression profiles to infer regulatory relationships, MEDUSA determines condition-specific regulators and discovers regulatory motifs that mediate the regulation of target genes. In this way, MEDUSA meaningfully models biological mechanisms of transcriptional regulation. MEDUSA solves the problem of predicting the differential (up/down) expression of target genes by using boosting, a technique from statistical learning, which helps to avoid overfitting as the algorithm searches through the high-dimensional space of potential regulators and sequence motifs. Experimental results demonstrate that MEDUSA achieves high prediction accuracy on held-out experiments (test data), that is, data not seen in training. We also present context-specific analysis of MEDUSA regulatory programs for DNA damage and hypoxia, demonstrating that MEDUSA identifies key regulators and motifs in these processes. A central challenge in the field is the difficulty of validating reverse-engineered networks in the absence of a gold standard. Our approach of learning regulatory programs provides at least a partial solution for the problem: MEDUSA's prediction accuracy on held-out data gives a concrete and statistically sound way to validate how well the algorithm performs. With MEDUSA, statistical validation becomes a prerequisite for hypothesis generation and network building rather than a secondary consideration.},

  abstract = {Despite the fact that G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest signal-conveying receptor family and mediate many physiological processes, their role in tumor biology is underappreciated. Numerous lines of evidence now associate GPCRs and their downstream signaling targets in cancer growth and development. Indeed, GPCRs control many features of tumorigenesis, including immune cell-mediated functions, proliferation, invasion and survival at the secondary site. Technological advances have further substantiated GPCR modifications in human tumors. Among these are point mutations, gene overexpression, GPCR silencing by promoter methylation and the number of gene copies. At this point, it is imperative to elucidate specific signaling pathways of "cancer driver" GPCRs. Emerging data on GPCR biology point to functional selectivity and "biased agonism"; hence, there is a diminishing enthusiasm for the concept of "one drug per GPCR target" and increasing interest in the identification of several drug options. Therefore, determining the appropriate context-dependent conformation of a functional GPCR as well as the contribution of GPCR alterations to cancer development remain significant challenges for the discovery of dominant cancer genes and the development of targeted therapeutics.},

  volume = {127},
  issn = {00207136},
  abstract = {The ability of cancer cells to escape from the natural or immunotherapy-induced antitumor immune response is often associated with alterations in the tumor cell surface expression of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class I antigens. Considerable knowledge has been gained on the prevalence of various patterns of MHC Class I defects and the underlying molecular mechanisms in different types of cancer. In contrast, few data are available on the changes in MHC Class I expression happening during the course of cancer immunotherapy. We have recently proposed that the progression or regression of a tumor lesion in cancer patients undergoing immunotherapy could be predetermined by the molecular mechanism responsible for the MHC Class I alteration and not by the type of immunotherapy used, i.e., interleukin-2 (IL-2), Bacillus Calmette-Gu{\`e}rin (BCG), interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), peptides alone, dendritic cells loaded with peptides, protein-bound polysaccharide etc. If the molecular alteration responsible for the changes in MHC Class I expression is reversible by cytokines ("soft" lesion), the MHC Class I expression will be upregulated, the specific T cell-mediated response will increase and the lesion will regress. However, if the molecular defect is structural ("hard" lesion), the MHC Class I expression will remain low, the escape mechanism will prevail and the primary tumor or the metastatic lesion will progress. According to this idea, the nature of the preexisting MHC Class I lesion in the cancer cell has a crucial impact determining the final outcome of cancer immunotherapy. In this article, we discuss the importance of these two types of molecular mechanisms of MHC Class I-altered expression.},

  abstract = {The use of antibodies in therapy and diagnosis has undergone an unprecedented expansion during the past two decades. This is due in part to innovations in antibody engineering that now offer opportunities for the production of "second generation" antibodies with multiple specificities or altered valencies. The targeting of individual components of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)3-PI3K signaling axis, including the preferred heterodimerization partner HER2, is known to have limited anti-tumor effects. The efficacy of antibodies or small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in targeting this axis is further reduced by the presence of the HER3 ligand, heregulin. To address these shortcomings, we performed a comparative analysis of two distinct approaches toward reducing the proliferation and signaling in HER2 overexpressing tumor cells in the presence of heregulin. These strategies both involve the use of engineered antibodies in combination with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/HER2 specific TKI, lapatinib. In the first approach, we generated a bispecific anti-HER2/HER3 antibody that, in the presence of lapatinib, is designed to sequester HER3 into inactive HER2-HER3 dimers that restrain HER3 interactions with other possible dimerization partners. The second approach involves the use of a tetravalent anti-HER3 antibody with the goal of inducing efficient HER3 internalization and degradation. In combination with lapatinib, we demonstrate that although the multivalent HER3 antibody is more effective than its bivalent counterpart in reducing heregulin-mediated signaling and growth, the bispecific HER2/HER3 antibody has increased inhibitory activity. Collectively, these observations provide support for the therapeutic use of bispecifics in combination with TKIs to recruit HER3 into complexes that are functionally inert.},

In ovarian cancer (OC), DNMTis trigger cytosolic sensing of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) causing a type I interferon response and apoptosis. Knocking down dsRNA sensors TLR3 and MAVS reduces this response 2-fold and blocking interferon beta or its receptor abrogates it. Upregulation of hypermethylated endogenous retrovirus (ERV) genes accompanies the response and ERV overexpression activates the response. Basal levels of ERV and viral defense gene expression significantly correlate in primary OC and the latter signature separates primary samples for multiple tumor types from The Cancer Genome Atlas into low versus high expression groups. In melanoma patients treated with an immune checkpoint therapy, high viral defense signature expression in tumors significantly associates with durable clinical response and DNMTi treatment sensitizes to anti-CTLA4 therapy in a pre-clinical melanoma model.},

  issn = {03043835},
  abstract = {The molecular mechanisms underlying the aggressive behavior of MYCN driven neuroblastoma (NBL) is under intense investigation; however, little is known about the impact of this family of transcription factors on the splicing program. Here we used high-throughput RNA sequencing to systematically study the expression of RNA isoforms in stage 4 MYCN-amplified NBL, an aggressive subtype of metastatic NBL. We show that MYCN-amplified NBL tumors display a distinct gene splicing pattern affecting multiple cancer hallmark functions. Six splicing factors displayed unique differential expression patterns in MYCN-amplified tumors and cell lines, and the binding motifs for some of these splicing factors are significantly enriched in differentially-spliced genes. Direct binding of MYCN to promoter regions of the splicing factors PTBP1 and HNRNPA1 detected by ChIP-seq demonstrates that MYCN controls the splicing pattern by direct regulation of the expression of these key splicing factors. Furthermore, high expression of PTBP1 and HNRNPA1 was significantly associated with poor overall survival of stage4 NBL patients (p {$\leq$} 0.05). Knocking down PTBP1, HNRNPA1 and their downstream target PKM2, an isoform of pro-tumor-growth, result in repressed growth of NBL cells. Therefore, our study reveals a novel role of MYCN in controlling global splicing program through regulation of splicing factors in addition to its well-known role in the transcription program. These findings suggest a therapeutically potential to target the key splicing factors or gene isoforms in high-risk NBL with MYCN-amplification.},

This more general Gaussian pro-cess latent variable model (GPLVM) is then evaluated as an approach to the visualisation of high dimensional data for three different data-sets. Additionally our non-linear algorithm can be further kernelised leading to 'twin kernel PCA' in which a mapping between feature spaces occurs.},

Constitutive nuclear factor (NF)-{$\kappa$}B and JAK kinase signalling promotes malignant cell survival in these lymphomas, but the genetic basis for this signalling is incompletely understood. Here we describe the dependence of ABC DLBCLs on MYD88, an adaptor protein that mediates toll and interleukin (IL)-1 receptor signalling, and the discovery of highly recurrent oncogenic mutations affecting MYD88 in ABC DLBCL tumours. RNA interference screening revealed that MYD88 and the associated kinases IRAK1 and IRAK4 are essential for ABC DLBCL survival. High-throughput RNA resequencing uncovered MYD88 mutations in ABC DLBCL lines. Notably, 29{{\%}} of ABC DLBCL tumours harboured the same amino acid substitution, L265P, in the MYD88 Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain at an evolutionarily invariant residue in its hydrophobic core. This mutation was rare or absent in other DLBCL subtypes and Burkitt's lymphoma, but was observed in 9{{\%}} of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas. At a lower frequency, additional mutations were observed in the MYD88 TIR domain, occurring in both the ABC and germinal centre B-cell-like (GCB) DLBCL subtypes. Survival of ABC DLBCL cells bearing the L265P mutation was sustained by the mutant but not the wild-type MYD88 isoform, demonstrating that L265P is a gain-of-function driver mutation. The L265P mutant promoted cell survival by spontaneously assembling a protein complex containing IRAK1 and IRAK4, leading to IRAK4 kinase activity, IRAK1 phosphorylation, NF-{$\kappa$}B signalling, JAK kinase activation of STAT3, and secretion of IL-6, IL-10 and interferon-{$\beta$}. Hence, the MYD88 signalling pathway is integral to the pathogenesis of ABC DLBCL, supporting the development of inhibitors of IRAK4 kinase and other components of this pathway for the treatment of tumours bearing oncogenic MYD88 mutations.},

  abstract = {Due to genome instability, most cancers exhibit loss of regions containing tumor suppressor genes and collateral loss of other genes. To identify cancer-specific vulnerabilities that are the result of copy number losses, we performed integrated analyses of genome-wide copy number and RNAi profiles and identified 56 genes for which gene suppression specifically inhibited the proliferation of cells harboring partial copy number loss of that gene. These CYCLOPS (copy number alterations yielding cancer liabilities owing to partial loss) genes are enriched for spliceosome, proteasome, and ribosome components. One CYCLOPS gene, PSMC2, encodes an essential member of the 19S proteasome. Normal cells express excess PSMC2, which resides in a complex with PSMC1, PSMD2, and PSMD5 and acts as a reservoir protecting cells from PSMC2 suppression. Cells harboring partial PSMC2 copy number loss lack this complex and die after PSMC2 suppression. These observations define a distinct class of cancer-specific liabilities resulting from genome instability.},

  volume = {14},

  abstract = {Cancer in children and adolescents is rare and biologically very different from cancer in adults. It accounts for 1\textperiodcentered{}4{{\%}} of all cancers worldwide, although this proportion ranges from 0\textperiodcentered{}5{{\%}} in Europe to 4\textperiodcentered{}8{{\%}} in Africa, largely because of differences in age composition and life expectancy. In high-income countries, survival from childhood cancer has reached 80{{\%}} through a continuous focus on the integration of clinical research into front-line care for nearly all children affected by malignant disease. However, further improvement must entail new biology-driven approaches, since optimisation of conventional treatments has in many cases reached its limits. In many instances, such approaches can only be achieved through international collaborative research, since rare cancers are being subdivided into increasingly smaller subgroups on the basis of their molecular characteristics. The long-term effect of anticancer treatment on quality of life must also be taken into account because more than one in 1000 adults in high-income countries are thought to be survivors of cancer in childhood or adolescence. The introduction of drugs that are less toxic and more targeted than those currently used necessitates a partnership between clinical and translational researchers, the pharmaceutical industry, drug regulators, and patients and their families. This therapeutic alliance will ensure that efforts are focused on the unmet clinical needs of young people with cancer. Most children with cancer live in low-income and middle-income countries, and these countries account for 94{{\%}} of all deaths from cancer in people aged 0-14 years. The immediate priority for these children is to improve access to an affordable, best standard of care in each country. Every country should have a national cancer plan that recognises the unique demographic characteristics and care needs of young people with cancer. Centralisation of the complex components of treatment of these rare diseases is essential to improve survival, accelerate research, and train the future specialist workforce. Referral routes and care pathways must take account of the large geographical distances between many patients' homes and treatment centres, and the economic, cultural, and linguistic diversity of the populations served.},

  abstract = {The use of correlation networks is widespread in the analysis of gene expression and proteomics data, even though it is known that correlations not only confound direct and indirect associations but also provide no means to distinguish between cause and effect. For "causal" analysis typically the inference of a directed graphical model is required. However, this is rather difficult due to the curse of dimensionality. We propose a simple heuristic for the statistical learning of a high-dimensional "causal" network. The method first converts a correlation network into a partial correlation graph. Subsequently, a partial ordering of the nodes is established by multiple testing of the log-ratio of standardized partial variances. This allows identifying a directed acyclic causal network as a subgraph of the partial correlation network. We illustrate the approach by analyzing a large Arabidopsis thaliana expression data set. The proposed approach is a heuristic algorithm that is based on a number of approximations, such as substituting lower order partial correlations by full order partial correlations. Nevertheless, for small samples and for sparse networks the algorithm not only yield sensible first order approximations of the causal structure in high-dimensional genomic data but is also computationally highly efficient. The method is implemented in the "GeneNet" R package (version 1.2.0), available from CRAN and from http://strimmerlab.org/software/genets/ . The software includes an R script for reproducing the network analysis of the Arabidopsis thaliana data.},

Recent research found abnormal expression of CSF-1R in human carcinomas of the breast, endometrium, and ovary. Furthermore, activation of CSF-1R by its ligand has been shown to regulate invasiveness and anchorage-independent growth in breast carcinoma cells. To study the significance of CSF-1R expression in breast cancer, we designed a case-controlled immunohistochemical study. We chose 80 patients from a database of 1200 early stage I or II breast cancer patients treated with conservative surgery and radiation therapy. Expression of CSF-1R in the tumors of 40 patients who experienced an ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) as a primary site of relapse were compared with 40 patients who had not experienced an IBTR. The index and control patients were matched by age, clinical stage, nodal status, and follow-up. Paraffin-embedded sections were immunostained with antibodies directed toward CSF-1R. For the CSF-1R antibody, a total of 28 index cases (70{{\%}}) demonstrated strong staining, whereas only 16 control cases (40{{\%}}) demonstrated high immunoreactivity (P = 0.007). The CSF-1R antibody showed a positive correlation for local relapse, but no correlation was found between CSF-1R expression and distant metastasis. In summary, our findings provide evidence for the poor prognostic role of CSF-1R in IBTR.},

A bivariate mixture model utilizing information across two species was proposed to solve the fundamental problem of identifying differentially expressed genes in microarray experiments in order to potentially improve the understanding of translation between preclinical and clinical studies for drug development. The proposed approach models the joint distribution of treatment effects estimated from independent linear models. The mixture model posits up to nine components, four of which include groups in which genes are differentially expressed in both species. A comprehensive simulation to evaluate the model performance and one application on a real world data set, a mouse and human type II diabetes experiment, suggest that the proposed model, though highly structured, can handle various configurations of differential gene expression and is practically useful on identifying differentially expressed genes, especially when the magnitude of differential expression due to different treatment intervention is weak. In the mouse and human application, the proposed mixture model was able to eliminate unimportant genes and identify a list of genes that were differentially expressed in both species and could be potential gene targets for drug development.},

  abstract = {High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGS-OvCa) has the lowest survival rate among all gynecologic cancers and is hallmarked by a high degree of heterogeneity. The Cancer Genome Atlas network has described a gene expression-based molecular classification of HGS-OvCa into Differentiated, Mesenchymal, Immunoreactive and Proliferative subtypes. However, the biological underpinnings and regulatory mechanisms underlying the distinct molecular subtypes are largely unknown. Here we showed that tumor-infiltrating stromal cells significantly contributed to the assignments of Mesenchymal and Immunoreactive clusters. Using reverse engineering and an unbiased interrogation of subtype regulatory networks, we identified the transcriptional modules containing master regulators that drive gene expression of Mesenchymal and Immunoreactive HGS-OvCa. Mesenchymal master regulators were associated with poor prognosis, while Immunoreactive master regulators positively correlated with overall survival. Meta-analysis of 749 HGS-OvCa expression profiles confirmed that master regulators as a prognostic signature were able to predict patient outcome. Our data unraveled master regulatory programs of HGS-OvCa subtypes with prognostic and potentially therapeutic relevance, and suggested that the unique transcriptional and clinical characteristics of ovarian Mesenchymal and Immunoreactive subtypes could be, at least partially, ascribed to tumor microenvironment.},

  abstract = {Microarray gene expression time-course experiments provide the opportunity to observe the evolution of transcriptional programs that cells use to respond to internal and external stimuli. Most commonly used methods for identifying differentially expressed genes treat each time point as independent and ignore important correlations, including those within samples and between sampling times. Therefore they do not make full use of the information intrinsic to the data, leading to a loss of power. We present a flexible random-effects model that takes such correlations into account, improving our ability to detect genes that have sustained differential expression over more than one time point. By modeling the joint distribution of the samples that have been profiled across all time points, we gain sensitivity compared to a marginal analysis that examines each time point in isolation. We assign each gene a probability of differential expression using an empirical Bayes approach that reduces the effective number of parameters to be estimated. Based on results from theory, simulated data, and application to the genomic data presented here, we show that BETR has increased power to detect subtle differential expression in time-series data. The open-source R package betr is available through Bioconductor. BETR has also been incorporated in the freely-available, open-source MeV software tool available from http://www.tm4.org/mev.html .},

Together, our results advance the collective knowledge about human genome function in several major areas. First, our studies provide convincing evidence that the genome is pervasively transcribed, such that the majority of its bases can be found in primary transcripts, including non-protein-coding transcripts, and those that extensively overlap one another. Second, systematic examination of transcriptional regulation has yielded new understanding about transcription start sites, including their relationship to specific regulatory sequences and features of chromatin accessibility and histone modification. Third, a more sophisticated view of chromatin structure has emerged, including its inter-relationship with DNA replication and transcriptional regulation. Finally, integration of these new sources of information, in particular with respect to mammalian evolution based on inter- and intra-species sequence comparisons, has yielded new mechanistic and evolutionary insights concerning the functional landscape of the human genome.

As the number and range of mutations detected by clinical NGS assays has increased, it is difficult to apply standard analyte-specific proficiency testing (PT). Most current proficiency testing challenges for NGS are methods-based PT surveys that use DNA from reference samples engineered to harbor specific mutations that test both sequence generation and bioinformatics analysis. These methods-based PTs are limited by the number and types of mutations that can be physically introduced into a single DNA sample. In silico proficiency testing, which evaluates only the bioinformatics component of NGS assays, is a recently introduced PT method that allows for evaluation of numerous mutations spanning a range of variant classes. In silico PT data sets can be generated from simulated or actual sequencing data and are used to test alignment through variant detection and annotation steps. In silico PT has several advantages over the use of physical samples, including greater flexibility in tested variants, the ability to design laboratory-specific challenges, and lower costs. Herein, we review the use of in silico PT as an alternative to traditional methods-based PT as it is evolving in oncology applications and discuss how the approach is applicable more broadly.},

  abstract = {The 5' to 3' exoribonuclease Xrn1 is a large protein involved in cytoplasmatic mRNA degradation as a critical component of the major decaysome. Its deletion in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is not lethal, but it has multiple physiological effects. In a previous study, our group showed that deletion of all tested components of the yeast major decaysome, including XRN1, results in a decrease in the synthetic rate and an increase in half-life of most mRNAs in a compensatory manner. Furthermore, the same study showed that the all tested decaysome components are also nuclear proteins that bind to the 5' region of a number of genes. In the present work, we show that disruption of Xrn1 activity preferentially affects both the synthesis and decay of a distinct subpopulation of mRNAs. The most affected mRNAs are the transcripts of the highly transcribed genes, mainly those encoding ribosome biogenesis and translation factors. Previously, we proposed that synthegradases play a key role in regulating both mRNA synthesis and degradation. Evidently, Xrn1 functions as a synthegradase, whose selectivity might help coordinating the expression of the protein synthetic machinery. We propose to name the most affected genes ``Xrn1 synthegradon''.},

  abstract = {Purpose RNA and DNA sequencing data are traditionally used to discern intrinsic cellular pathways in cancer pathogenesis, their utility for investigating the tumor microenvironment has not been fully explored. This study explores the use of sequencing data to investigate immunity within the tumor microenvironment. Experimental design Here we use immune cell fraction estimation analysis to determine the immune profiles in the microenvironment of neuroblastoma based on RNAseq data in the TARGET database. The correlation between immune cell transcripts and prognosis in pediatric neuroblastoma is also investigated. Results In silico analysis revealed a strong inverse correlation between MYCN amplification and leukocyte infiltration. This finding was validated by immunohistochemistry analysis in tumor samples. Moreover, the abundance of CD4 T cells strongly associated with better patient survival regardless of MYCN gene amplification, while those of CD8 T cells, NK or B cells do not. Based on characteristic cytokine expression of CD4 subsets in tumors, the Th2 rather than Th1 levels were associated with better prognosis. Conclusion We found that the in silico analysis of TARGET database reflected tumor immunity and was validated by the immuno-histochemical tumor data. Our results reveal the association of MYCN amplification with repressed cellular immunity and the potential prognostic value of infiltrating CD4 T cell transcripts in pediatric neuroblastoma. This analysis illustrates the potential role of MYCN in neuroblastoma as a regulator of immune privilege and characterizes the power of in silico analysis for delineating cancer immunology and risk stratification.},

Variation in transcriptional programs accounts for much of the biological diversity of human cells and tumours. In each cell, signal transduction and regulatory systems transduce information from the cell's identity to its environmental status, thereby controlling the level of expression of every gene in the genome. Here we have characterized variation in gene expression patterns in a set of 65 surgical specimens of human breast tumours from 42 different individuals, using complementary DNA microarrays representing 8,102 human genes. These patterns provided a distinctive molecular portrait of each tumour. Twenty of the tumours were sampled twice, before and after a 16-week course of doxorubicin chemotherapy, and two tumours were paired with a lymph node metastasis from the same patient. Gene expression patterns in two tumour samples from the same individual were almost always more similar to each other than either was to any other sample. Sets of co-expressed genes were identified for which variation in messenger RNA levels could be related to specific features of physiological variation. The tumours could be classified into subtypes distinguished by pervasive differences in their gene expression patterns.},

  abstract = {Colorectal cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancer types worldwide. Identification of the key regulators of the altered biological networks is crucial for understanding the complex molecular mechanisms of colorectal cancer. We proposed a gene module based approach to infer key miRNAs regulating the major gene network alterations in cancer tissues. By integrating gene differential expression and co-expression information with a protein-protein interaction network, the differential gene expression modules, which captured the major gene network changes, were identified for colorectal cancer. Then, several key miRNAs, which extensively regulate the gene modules, were inferred by analyzing their target gene enrichment in the modules. Among the inferred candidates, three miRNAs, miR-101, miR-124 and miR-139, are frequently down-regulated in colorectal cancers. The following computational and experimental analyses demonstrate that miR-139 can inhibit cell proliferation and cell cycle G1/S transition. A known oncogene ETS1, a key transcription factor in the gene module, was experimentally verified as a novel target of miR-139. miR-139 was found to be significantly down-regulated in early pathological cancer stages and its expression remained at very low levels in advanced stages. These results indicate that miR-139, inferred by the gene module based approach, should be a key tumor suppressor in early cancer development.},

We developed a combinatorial approach including translational profiling and brain regulatory network analysis to search for key determinants of neuronal survival or death. Following the generation of transgenic mice for cell type-specific profiling of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, we established and compared translatome libraries reflecting the molecular signature of these cells at baseline or under degenerative stress. Analysis of these libraries by interrogating a context-specific brain regulatory network led to the identification of a repertoire of intrinsic upstream regulators that drive the dopaminergic stress response. The altered activity of these regulators was not associated with changes in their expression levels. This strategy can be generalized for the identification of molecular determinants involved in the degeneration of other classes of neurons.},

  abstract = {Breast cancer patients with the same stage of disease can have markedly different treatment responses and overall outcome. The strongest predictors for metastases (for example, lymph node status and histological grade) fail to classify accurately breast tumours according to their clinical behaviour. Chemotherapy or hormonal therapy reduces the risk of distant metastases by approximately one-third; however, 70-80{{\%}} of patients receiving this treatment would have survived without it. None of the signatures of breast cancer gene expression reported to date allow for patient-tailored therapy strategies. Here we used DNA microarray analysis on primary breast tumours of 117 young patients, and applied supervised classification to identify a gene expression signature strongly predictive of a short interval to distant metastases ('poor prognosis' signature) in patients without tumour cells in local lymph nodes at diagnosis (lymph node negative). In addition, we established a signature that identifies tumours of BRCA1 carriers. The poor prognosis signature consists of genes regulating cell cycle, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. This gene expression profile will outperform all currently used clinical parameters in predicting disease outcome. Our findings provide a strategy to select patients who would benefit from adjuvant therapy.},

Since most of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying neuroblastoma onset and progression remain unknown, the generation of new in vivo models might be appropriate to better dissect the peripheral sympathetic nervous system development in both physiological and disease states. This review is focused on the use of zebrafish as a suitable and innovative model to study neuroblastoma development. Here, we briefly summarize the current knowledge about zebrafish peripheral sympathetic nervous system formation, focusing on key genes and cellular pathways that play a crucial role in the differentiation of sympathetic neurons during embryonic development. In addition, we include examples of how genetic changes known to be associated with aggressive neuroblastoma can mimic this malignancy in zebrafish. Thus, we note the value of the zebrafish model in the field of neuroblastoma research, showing how it can improve our current knowledge about genes and biological pathways that contribute to malignant transformation and progression during embryonic life.},

Many markers, signatures, and methods have been described to evaluate the prognosis of cancer patients, yet very few translate into the clinic. Systems biology approaches have facilitated analysis of the complex interaction between tumors and the host-immune response, and allowed the definition of the immune contexture. Here we review the potential of the immune contexture, quantified by the Immunoscore, to provide a statistically strong parameter for prognosis. Finally we introduce the concept that the host-immune reaction could be the critical element in determining response to therapy. The effect on the immune response could be the underlying factor behind many of the predictive markers.},

The interaction between them is finely balanced through the processes of bone formation and bone remodeling, which regulates the production and biological activity of many soluble factors and extracellular matrix components needed to maintain the bone homeostasis in terms of cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Osteosarcoma (OS) emerges in this complex environment as a result of poorly defined oncogenic events arising in osteogenic lineage precursors. Increasing evidence supports that similar to normal development, the bone microenvironment (BME) underlies OS initiation and progression. Here, we recapitulate the physiological processes that regulate bone homeostasis and review the current knowledge about how OS cells and BME communicate and interact, describing how these interactions affect OS cell growth, metastasis, cancer stem cell fate and therapy outcome.},

Normal-tumor genome pairs are routinely sequenced together to find somatic mutations and their associations with different cancers. Parental and sibling genomes reveal de novo germline mutations and inheritance patterns related to Mendelian diseases.Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common paediatric cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related death among children. With the aim of uncovering the full spectrum of germline and somatic genetic alterations in childhood ALL genomes, we conducted whole-exome re-sequencing on a unique cohort of over 120 exomes of childhood ALL quartets, each comprising a patient's tumor and matched-normal material, and DNA from both parents. We developed a general probabilistic model for such quartet sequencing reads mapped to the reference human genome. The model is used to infer joint genotypes at homologous loci across a normal-tumor genome pair and two parental genomes.We describe the algorithms and data structures for genotype inference, model parameter training. We implemented the methods in an open-source software package (QUADGT) that uses the standard file formats of the 1000 Genomes Project. Our method's utility is illustrated on quartets from the ALL cohort.},

Here, we present a probabilistic framework that integrates association strength with functional genomic annotation data to improve accuracy in selecting plausible causal variants for functional validation. A key feature of our approach is that it empirically estimates the contribution of each functional annotation to the trait of interest directly from summary association statistics while allowing for multiple causal variants at any risk locus. We devise efficient algorithms that estimate the parameters of our model across all risk loci to further increase performance. Using simulations starting from the 1000 Genomes data, we find that our framework consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art fine-mapping methods, reducing the number of variants that need to be selected to capture 90{{\%}} of the causal variants from an average of 13.3 to 10.4 SNPs per locus (as compared to the next-best performing strategy). Furthermore, we introduce a cost-to-benefit optimization framework for determining the number of variants to be followed up in functional assays and assess its performance using real and simulation data. We validate our findings using a large scale meta-analysis of four blood lipids traits and find that the relative probability for causality is increased for variants in exons and transcription start sites and decreased in repressed genomic regions at the risk loci of these traits. Using these highly predictive, trait-specific functional annotations, we estimate causality probabilities across all traits and variants, reducing the size of the 90{{\%}} confidence set from an average of 17.5 to 13.5 variants per locus in this data.},

Targeting oncogenic transcription through either of these methods synergizes with HDAC inhibition, and DIPG cells resistant to HDAC inhibitor therapy retain sensitivity to CDK7 blockade. Identification of super-enhancers in DIPG provides insights toward the cell of origin, highlighting oligodendroglial lineage genes, and reveals unexpected mechanisms mediating tumor viability and invasion, including potassium channel function and EPH receptor signaling. The findings presented demonstrate transcriptional vulnerabilities and elucidate previously unknown mechanisms of DIPG pathobiology.},

Integrative analysis of genomic and proteomic profiles challenges the notion of therapeutic inhibition of a pathway as an alternative to inhibition of the target itself.

Increasing numbers of experimental models have begun to shed light on to the likely cell population that gives rise to OS in vivo with the weight of evidence favoring an osteoblastic population as the cell of origin. As more information is gathered regarding osteosarcoma initiating cells and how they may relate to the cell of origin we will derive a better understanding of the development of this disease which may ultimately lead to clinical improvements through more personalized therapeutic approaches.},

  abstract = {Tumor necrosis factor-{$\alpha$} (TNF{$\alpha$}) was cloned over 2 decades ago and its identification in part led to the discovery of a super family of tumor necrosis factors (TNFs) and their receptors. TNF{$\alpha$} signals through two transmembrane receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2, and regulates a number of critical cell functions including cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, and apoptosis. Macrophages are the major producers of TNF{$\alpha$} and interestingly are also highly responsive to TNF{$\alpha$}. Aberrant TNF{$\alpha$} production and TNF receptor signaling have been associated with the pathogenesis of several diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, atherosclerosis, psoriasis, sepsis, diabetes, and obesity. TNF{$\alpha$} has been shown to play a pivotal role in orchestrating the cytokine cascade in many inflammatory diseases and because of this role as a "master-regulator" of inflammatory cytokine production, it has been proposed as a therapeutic target for a number of diseases. Indeed anti-TNF{$\alpha$} drugs are now licensed for treating certain inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. In this review we discuss the discovery of TNF{$\alpha$} and its actions especially in regulating macrophage biology. Given its importance in several human diseases, we also briefly discuss the role of anti-TNF{$\alpha$} therapeutics in the treatment of inflammatory diseases.},

  title = {Effect of Transcription Factor Resource Sharing on Gene Expression Noise},
  volume = {13},
  issn = {1553-7358},
  abstract = {Gene expression is intrinsically a stochastic (noisy) process with important implications for cellular functions. Deciphering the underlying mechanisms of gene expression noise remains one of the key challenges of regulatory biology. Theoretical models of transcription often incorporate the kinetics of how transcription factors (TFs) interact with a single promoter to impact gene expression noise. However, inside single cells multiple identical gene copies as well as additional binding sites can compete for a limiting pool of TFs. Here we develop a simple kinetic model of transcription, which explicitly incorporates this interplay between TF copy number and its binding sites. We show that TF sharing enhances noise in mRNA distribution across an isogenic population of cells. Moreover, when a single gene copy shares it's TFs with multiple competitor sites, the mRNA variance as a function of the mean remains unaltered by their presence. Hence, all the data for variance as a function of mean expression collapse onto a single master curve independent of the strength and number of competitor sites. However, this result does not hold true when the competition stems from multiple copies of the same gene. Therefore, although previous studies showed that the mean expression follows a universal master curve, our findings suggest that different scenarios of competition bear distinct signatures at the level of variance. Intriguingly, the introduction of competitor sites can transform a unimodal mRNA distribution into a multimodal distribution. These results demonstrate the impact of limited availability of TF resource on the regulation of noise in gene expression.},

  issn = {1365-2796},
  abstract = {Obesity is a risk factor for a plethora of severe morbidities and premature death. Most supporting evidence comes from observational studies that are prone to chance, bias and confounding. Even data on the protective effects of weight loss from randomized controlled trials will be susceptible to confounding and bias if treatment assignment cannot be masked, which is usually the case with lifestyle and surgical interventions. Thus, whilst obesity is widely considered the major modifiable risk factor for many chronic diseases, its causes and consequences are often difficult to determine. Addressing this is important, as the prevention and treatment of any disease requires that interventions focus on causal risk factors. Disease prediction, although not dependent on knowing the causes, is nevertheless enhanced by such knowledge. Here, we provide an overview of some of the barriers to causal inference in obesity research and discuss analytical approaches, such as Mendelian randomization, that can help to overcome these obstacles. In a systematic review of the literature in this field, we found: (i) probable causal relationships between adiposity and bone health/disease, cancers (colorectal, lung and kidney cancers), cardiometabolic traits (blood pressure, fasting insulin, inflammatory markers and lipids), uric acid concentrations, coronary heart disease and venous thrombosis (in the presence of pulmonary embolism), (ii) possible causal relationships between adiposity and gray matter volume, depression and common mental disorders, oesophageal cancer, macroalbuminuria, end-stage renal disease, diabetic kidney disease, nuclear cataract and gall stone disease, and (iii) no evidence for causal relationships between adiposity and Alzheimer's disease, pancreatic cancer, venous thrombosis (in the absence of pulmonary embolism), liver function and periodontitis.},

Like basophils, mast cells express the high-affinity receptor for immunoglobulin E (IgE) and have been linked to host defense and diverse immune-system-mediated diseases. To better characterize the function of these cells, we assessed the transcriptional profiles of mast cells isolated from peripheral connective tissues and basophils isolated from spleen and blood. We found that mast cells were transcriptionally distinct, clustering independently from all other profiled cells, and that mast cells demonstrated considerably greater heterogeneity across tissues than previously appreciated. We observed minimal homology between mast cells and basophils, which shared more overlap with other circulating granulocytes than with mast cells. The derivation of mast-cell and basophil transcriptional signatures underscores their differential capacities to detect environmental signals and influence the inflammatory milieu.},

Appreciating the now apparent functional heterogeneity of osteosarcoma cells within and between individual tumors will likely be critical in developing much needed novel effective therapies.

Despite the development of targeted therapies that inhibit the oncogenic mutations driving a subset of lung cancer cases, there is a paucity of effective treatments for the majority of lung cancer patients and new strategies are urgently needed. In recent years, the concept of synthetic lethality has been established as an effective approach for discovering novel cancer-specific targets as well as a method to improve the efficacy of existing drugs which provide partial but insufficient benefits for patients. In this review, we discuss the concept of synthetic lethality, the various types of synthetic lethal interactions in the context of oncology and the approaches used to identify these interactions, including recent advances that have transformed the ability to discover novel synthetic lethal combinations on a global scale. Lastly, we describe the specific synthetic lethal interactions identified in lung cancer to date and explore the pharmacological challenges and considerations in translating these discoveries to the clinic.},

To address these challenges, we present OncoRep, an RNA-Seq based n-of-1 reporting tool for breast cancer patients. It reports molecular classification, altered genes and pathways, gene fusions, clinically actionable mutations and drug recommendations. It visualizes the data in an approachable html-based interactive report and a PDF clinical report, providing the clinician and tumor board with a tool to guide the treatment decision making process.

  abstract = {Neuroblastoma, the most common and deadly solid tumor in children, exhibits heterogeneous clinical behavior, from spontaneous regression to relentless progression. Current evidence suggests that the TRK family of neurotrophin receptors plays a critical role in these diverse behaviors. Neuroblastomas expressing TrkA are biologically favorable and prone to spontaneous regression or differentiation, depending on the absence or presence of its ligand (NGF) in the microenvironment. In contrast, TrkB-expressing tumors frequently have MYCN amplification and are very aggressive and often fatal tumors. These tumors also express the TrkB ligand (BDNF), resulting in an autocrine or paracrine survival pathway. Exposure to BDNF promotes survival, drug resistance, and angiogenesis of TrkB-expressing tumors. Here we review the role of Trks in normal development, the different functions of Trk isoforms, and the major Trk signaling pathways. We also review the roles these receptors play in the heterogeneous biological and clinical behavior of neuroblastomas, and the activation of Trk receptors in other cancers. Finally we address the progress that has been made in developing targeted therapy with Trk-selective inhibitors to treat neuroblastomas and other tumors with activated Trk expression.},

  abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

  abstract = {The effort to personalize treatment plans for cancer patients involves the identification of drug treatments that can effectively target the disease while minimizing the likelihood of adverse reactions. In this study, the gene-expression profile of 810 cancer cell lines and their response data to 368 small molecules from the Cancer Therapeutics Research Portal (CTRP) are analyzed to identify pathways with significant rewiring between genes, or differential gene dependency, between sensitive and non-sensitive cell lines. Identified pathways and their corresponding differential dependency networks are further analyzed to discover essentiality and specificity mediators of cell line response to drugs/compounds. For analysis we use the previously published method EDDY (Evaluation of Differential DependencY). EDDY first constructs likelihood distributions of gene-dependency networks, aided by known genegene interaction, for two given conditions, for example, sensitive cell lines vs. non-sensitive cell lines. These sets of networks yield a divergence value between two distributions of network likelihoods that can be assessed for significance using permutation tests. Resulting differential dependency networks are then further analyzed to identify genes, termed mediators, which may play important roles in biological signaling in certain cell lines that are sensitive or non-sensitive to the drugs. Establishing statistical correspondence between compounds and mediators can improve understanding of known gene dependencies associated with drug response while also discovering new dependencies. Millions of compute hours resulted in thousands of these statistical discoveries. EDDY identified 8,811 statistically significant pathways leading to 26,822 compound-pathway-mediator triplets. By incorporating STITCH and STRING databases, we could construct evidence networks for 14,415 compound-pathway-mediator triplets for support. The results of this analysis are presented in a searchable website to aid researchers in studying potential molecular mechanisms underlying cells' drug response as well as in designing experiments for the purpose of personalized treatment regimens.},

  title = {Oncology {{Meets Immunology}}: {{The Cancer}}-{{Immunity Cycle}}},
  volume = {39},
  abstract = {The genetic and cellular alterations that define cancer provide the immune system with the means to generate T cell responses that recognize and eradicate cancer cells. However, elimination of cancer by T cells is only one step in the Cancer-Immunity Cycle, which manages the delicate balance between the recognition of nonself and the prevention of autoimmunity. Identification of cancer cell T cell inhibitory signals, including PD-L1, has prompted the development of a new class of cancer immunotherapy that specifically hinders immune effector inhibition, reinvigorating and potentially expanding preexisting anticancer immune re-sponses. The presence of suppressive factors in the tumor microenvironment may explain the limited activity observed with previous immune-based therapies and why these therapies may be more effective in combi-nation with agents that target other steps of the cycle. Emerging clinical data suggest that cancer immuno-therapy is likely to become a key part of the clinical management of cancer. Introduction The development of cancer immunotherapy has reached an important inflection point in the history of cancer therapy (reviewed in Mellman et al., 2011). Durable monotherapy re-sponses are consistently being reported for a broad range of human cancers with several different agents (Hamid et al., 2013a; Herbst et al., 2013; Hodi et al., 2010; Topalian et al., 2012b), providing a compelling argument that cancer immuno-therapy is active in a range of indications beyond melanoma, a disease often thought to be atypically immunogenic (Jacobs et al., 2012). In addition to encouraging activity, many of the can-cer immunotherapy approaches report safety profiles that are milder and more manageable than traditional or targeted (i.e., oncogene-centric) cancer therapies. Cancer is characterized by the accumulation of a variable number of genetic alterations and the loss of normal cellular reg-ulatory processes (Tian et al., 2011). These events have long been known to result in the expression of neoantigens, differen-tiation antigens, or cancer testis antigens, which can lead to pre-sentation of peptides bound to major histocompatibility class I (MHCI) molecules on the surface of cancer cells, distinguishing them from their normal counterparts. Since the work of Boon and colleagues, we have known that these cancer-specific pep-tide-MHCI complexes can be recognized by CD8 + T cells},

  abstract = {Myc is an oncogene deregulated in most-perhaps all-human cancers. Each Myc family member, c-, L-, and N-Myc, has been connected to tumor progression and maintenance. Myc is recognized as a "most wanted" target for cancer therapy, but has for many years been considered undruggable, mainly due to its nuclear localization, lack of a defined ligand binding site, and physiological function essential to the maintenance of normal tissues. The challenge of identifying a pharmacophore capable of overcoming these hurdles is reflected in the current absence of a clinically-viable Myc inhibitor. The first attempts to inhibit Myc used antisense technology some three decades ago, followed by small molecule inhibitors discovered through "classical" compound library screens. Notable breakthroughs proving the feasibility of systemic Myc inhibition were made with the Myc dominant negative mutant Omomyc, showing both the great promise in targeting this infamous oncogene for cancer treatment as well as allaying fears about the deleterious side effects that Myc inhibition might have on normal proliferating tissues. During this time many other strategies have appeared in an attempt to drug the undruggable, including direct and indirect targeting, knockdown, protein/protein and DNA interaction inhibitors, and translation and expression regulation. The inhibitors range from traditional small molecules to natural chemicals, to RNA and antisense, to peptides and miniproteins. Here, we briefly describe the many approaches taken so far, with a particular focus on their potential clinical applicability.},

  volume = {15},
  issn = {1549-1676},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND Adaptive immune resistance induces an immunosuppressive tumor environment that enables immune evasion. This phenomenon results in tumor escape with progression and metastasis. Programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expressed on tumors is thought to inhibit tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) through programmed cell death 1 (PD1), enabling adaptive immune resistance. This study investigates the role of PD-L1 in both mouse and human neuroblastoma immunity. The consequence of PD-L1 inhibition is characterized in the context of an established whole tumor cell vaccine. METHODS AND FINDINGS A mouse model of neuroblastoma was investigated using an Id2 knockdown whole cell vaccine in combination with checkpoint inhibition. We show that immunogenic mouse neuroblastoma acquires adaptive immune resistance by up-regulating PD-L1 expression, whereas PD-L1 is of lesser consequence in nonimmunogenic neuroblastoma tumors. Combining PD-L1 checkpoint inhibition with whole tumor cell/anti-CTLA-4 vaccination enhanced tumor cell killing, cured mice with established tumors, and induced long-term immune memory (6 months). From an evaluation of patient neuroblastoma tumors, we found that the inflammatory environment of the mouse neuroblastoma mimicked human disease in which PD-L1 expression was associated directly with TILs and lower-risk tumors. High-risk patient tumors were lacking both TILs and PD-L1 expression. Although a correlation in immunity seems to exist between the mouse model and human findings, the mouse tumor model is induced and not spontaneously occurring, and furthermore, the number of both mouse and human correlates is limited. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates the role PD-L1 plays in neuroblastoma's resistance to immunity and defines the nonredundant effect of combination checkpoint inhibition with vaccine therapy in a mouse model. High-risk, nonimmunogenic human tumors display both diminished PD-L1 expression and adaptive immune resistance. Paradoxically, high-risk tumors may be more responsive to effective vaccine therapy because of their apparent lack of adaptive immune resistance.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW Building upon preclinical advances, we are uncovering immunotherapy strategies that are translating into improved outcomes in tumor subsets. Advanced pediatric solid tumors carry poor prognoses and resultant robust efforts to apply immunotherapy advances to pediatric solid tumors are in progress. Here, we discuss recent developments in the field using mAb and mAb-based therapies including checkpoint blockade and chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). RECENT FINDINGS The pediatric solid tumor mAb experience targeting the diganglioside, GD2, for patients with neuroblastoma has been the most compelling to date. GD2 and alternative antigen-specific mAbs are now being incorporated into antibody-drug conjugates, bispecific antibodies and CARs for treatment of solid tumors. CARs in pediatric solid tumors have not yet achieved comparative responses to the hematologic CAR experience; however, novel strategies such as bispecific targeting, intratumoral administration and improved understanding of T-cell biology may yield enhanced CAR-efficacy. Therapeutic effect using single-agent checkpoint blocking antibodies in pediatric solid tumors also remains limited to date. Combinatorial strategies continue to hold promise and the clinical effect in tumor subsets with high antigenic burden is being explored. SUMMARY Pediatric immunotherapy remains at early stages of translation, yet we anticipate that with advanced technology, we will achieve widespread, efficacious use of immunotherapy for pediatric solid tumors.},

  abstract = {Analyses intended to identify genes with expression that is associated with some clinical outcome or state are often based on ranked p-values from tests of point null hypotheses of no association. Van de Wiel and Kim take the innovative approach of testing the interval null hypotheses that the degree of association for a gene is less than some value of interest against the alternative that it is greater. Combining this idea with the false discovery rate controlling methods of Storey, Taylor and Siegmund gives a computationally simple way to identify true discovery rate degree of association (TDRDA) sets of genes among which a specified proportion are expected to have an absolute association of a specified degree or more. This leads to a gene ranking method that uses the maximum lower bound degree of association for which each gene belongs to a TDRDA set. Estimates of each gene's actual degree of association with approximate correction for 'selection bias' due to regression to the mean (RM) can be derived using simple bivariate normal theory and Efron and Tibshirani's empirical Bayes approach. For a given data set, all possible TDRDA sets can be displayed along with the gene ranking and the RM-corrected estimates of degree of association in a concise graphical summary.},

This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial.

The neurotrophin-3-induced cell migration was also observed in Schwann cells isolated from sciatic nerves of p75NTR-/- mice, indicating that neurotrophin 3 enhances cell migration through TrkC. This effect was blocked by K252a, an inhibitor of the Trk receptor family. Additionally, the neurotrophin-3-induced cell migration depended on Rho GTPases (Rac1 and Cdc42) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase. We obtained the same results with Cos-7 cells expressing TrkC.

  abstract = {Most tumor cells express antigens that can mediate recognition by host CD8(+) T cells. Cancers that are detected clinically must have evaded antitumor immune responses to grow progressively. Recent work has suggested two broad categories of tumor escape based on cellular and molecular characteristics of the tumor microenvironment. One major subset shows a T cell-inflamed phenotype consisting of infiltrating T cells, a broad chemokine profile and a type I interferon signature indicative of innate immune activation. These tumors appear to resist immune attack through the dominant inhibitory effects of immune system-suppressive pathways. The other major phenotype lacks this T cell-inflamed phenotype and appears to resist immune attack through immune system exclusion or ignorance. These two major phenotypes of tumor microenvironment may require distinct immunotherapeutic interventions for maximal therapeutic effect.},

However, whether blocking PD-1 can reprogram TEX into durable memory T cells (TMEM) is unclear. We found that reinvigoration of TEX in mice by PD-L1 blockade caused minimal memory development. After blockade, reinvigorated TEX became reexhausted if antigen concentration remained high and failed to become TMEM upon antigen clearance. TEX acquired an epigenetic profile distinct from that of effector T cells (TEFF) and TMEM cells that was minimally remodeled after PD-L1 blockade. This finding suggests that TEX are a distinct lineage of CD8 T cells. Nevertheless, PD-1 pathway blockade resulted in transcriptional rewiring and reengagement of effector circuitry in the TEX epigenetic landscape. These data indicate that epigenetic fate inflexibility may limit current immunotherapies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Ibrutinib is an irreversible inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) and is effective in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Resistance to irreversible kinase inhibitors and resistance associated with BTK inhibition have not been characterized. Although only a small proportion of patients have had a relapse during ibrutinib therapy, an understanding of resistance mechanisms is important. We evaluated patients with relapsed disease to identify mutations that may mediate ibrutinib resistance. METHODS We performed whole-exome sequencing at baseline and the time of relapse on samples from six patients with acquired resistance to ibrutinib therapy. We then performed functional analysis of identified mutations. In addition, we performed Ion Torrent sequencing for identified resistance mutations on samples from nine patients with prolonged lymphocytosis. RESULTS We identified a cysteine-to-serine mutation in BTK at the binding site of ibrutinib in five patients and identified three distinct mutations in PLC{$\gamma$}2 in two patients. Functional analysis showed that the C481S mutation of BTK results in a protein that is only reversibly inhibited by ibrutinib. The R665W and L845F mutations in PLC{$\gamma$}2 are both potentially gain-of-function mutations that lead to autonomous B-cell-receptor activity. These mutations were not found in any of the patients with prolonged lymphocytosis who were taking ibrutinib. CONCLUSIONS Resistance to the irreversible BTK inhibitor ibrutinib often involves mutation of a cysteine residue where ibrutinib binding occurs. This finding, combined with two additional mutations in PLC{$\gamma$}2 that are immediately downstream of BTK, underscores the importance of the B-cell-receptor pathway in the mechanism of action of ibrutinib in CLL.

Bypass of replicative senescence precipitates catastrophic telomere shortening or crisis, and is characterized by widespread genomic instability. Activation of a telomere maintenance mechanism (TMM) is necessary to stabilise the genome and establish cellular immortality through the reconstitution of telomere capping function. The alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway is a TMM frequently activated in tumors of mesenchymal or neuroepithelial origin. ALT is a homology-directed recombination-dependent replication pathway that utilizes telomeric templates for synthesis; however, its precise protein requirements have remained elusive. Recently, several developments have shed light on the DNA repair pathways that become engaged at ALT telomeres, implicating ALT telomeres as DNA repair hot spots. Here, we review recent discoveries regarding the ALT mechanism, and discuss how DNA repair pathways converge to maintain the length and functional integrity of telomeres in ALT cancers.},

Computationally, we apply a Bayesian FDR approach to control the number of rejections of null hypotheses. To check if our model assumptions for the test statistics are valid for various bioinformatics experiments, we also propose a simple graphical model-assessment tool.

We first obtain a penalized estimate of a partial correlation matrix using ridge penalty. Next we select the non-zero entries of the partial correlation matrix by hypothesis testing. Finally we re-estimate the partial correlation coefficients at these non-zero entries. In the second step, the null distribution of the test statistics derived from penalized partial correlation estimates has not been established. We address this challenge by estimating the null distribution from the empirical distribution of the test statistics of all the penalized partial correlation estimates. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate the good performance of our method. Application on a yeast cell cycle gene expression data shows that our method delivers better predictions of the protein-protein interactions than the Graphic Lasso.},

METHODS Incidence and survival data for childhood cancers came from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 9 (SEER 9) registries, and mortality data were based on deaths in the United States that were reported by states to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by underlying cause. RESULTS Childhood cancer incidence rates increased significantly from 1975 through 2006, with increasing rates for acute lymphoblastic leukemia being most notable. Childhood cancer mortality rates declined by more than 50{{\%}} between 1975 and 2006. For leukemias and lymphomas, significantly decreasing mortality rates were observed throughout the 32-year period, though the rate of decline slowed somewhat after 1998. For remaining childhood cancers, significantly decreasing mortality rates were observed from 1975 to 1996, with stable rates from 1996 through 2006. Increased survival rates were observed for all categories of childhood cancers studied, with the extent and temporal pace of the increases varying by diagnosis. CONCLUSION When 1975 age-specific death rates for children are used as a baseline, approximately 38,000 childhood malignant cancer deaths were averted in the United States from 1975 through 2006 as a result of more effective treatments identified and applied during this period. Continued success in reducing childhood cancer mortality will require new treatment paradigms building on an increased understanding of the molecular processes that promote growth and survival of specific childhood cancers.},

Mutations in the ATRX gene cause ATR-X syndrome, an X-linked recessive developmental disorder resulting in severe mental retardation and mild alpha-thalassemia with facial, skeletal and genital abnormalities. Although ubiquitously expressed the clinical features of the syndrome indicate that ATRX is not likely to be a global regulator of gene expression but involved in regulating specific target genes. The regulation of ATRX expression is not well understood and this is reflected by the current lack of identified upstream regulators. The availability of genomic data from a range of species and the very highly conserved 5' regulatory regions of the ATRX gene has allowed us to investigate putative transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) in evolutionarily conserved regions of the mammalian ATRX promoter. We identified 12 highly conserved TFBSs of key gene regulators involved in biologically relevant processes such as neural and testis development and alpha-globin regulation. Our results reveal potentially important regulatory elements in the ATRX gene which may lead to the identification of upstream regulators of ATRX and aid in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie ATR-X syndrome.},

With the development of the next-generation sequencing technology, multiple omics data, such as cancer genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic data etc., can be measured from each individual. Correspondingly, one of the key challenges is to pinpoint functional driver mutations or pathways, which contributes to tumorigenesis, from millions of functional neutral passenger mutations. RESULTS In this paper, in order to identify driver genes effectively, we applied a generalized additive model to mutation profiles to filter genes with long length and constructed a new gene-gene interaction network. Then we integrated the mutation data and expression data into the gene-gene interaction network. Lastly, greedy algorithm was used to prioritize candidate driver genes from the integrated data. We named the proposed method Length-Net-Driver (LNDriver). CONCLUSIONS Experiments on three TCGA datasets, i.e., head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma and thyroid carcinoma, demonstrated that the proposed method was effective. Also, it can identify not only frequently mutated drivers, but also rare candidate driver genes.},

  volume = {17},
  issn = {1471-2164},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND Genome-scale functional genomic screens across large cell line panels provide a rich resource for discovering tumor vulnerabilities that can lead to the next generation of targeted therapies. Their data analysis typically has focused on identifying genes whose knockdown enhances response in various pre-defined genetic contexts, which are limited by biological complexities as well as the incompleteness of our knowledge. We thus introduce a complementary data mining strategy to identify genes with exceptional sensitivity in subsets, or outlier groups, of cell lines, allowing an unbiased analysis without any a priori assumption about the underlying biology of dependency. RESULTS Genes with outlier features are strongly and specifically enriched with those known to be associated with cancer and relevant biological processes, despite no a priori knowledge being used to drive the analysis. Identification of exceptional responders (outliers) may not lead only to new candidates for therapeutic intervention, but also tumor indications and response biomarkers for companion precision medicine strategies. Several tumor suppressors have an outlier sensitivity pattern, supporting and generalizing the notion that tumor suppressors can play context-dependent oncogenic roles. CONCLUSIONS The novel application of outlier analysis described here demonstrates a systematic and data-driven analytical strategy to decipher large-scale functional genomic data for oncology target and precision medicine discoveries.},

  abstract = {There is a need to design computational methods to support the prediction of gene regulatory networks. Such models should offer both biologically-meaningful and computationally-accurate predictions, which in combination with other techniques may improve large-scale, integrative studies. This paper presents a new machine learning method for the prediction of putative regulatory associations from expression data, which exhibit properties never or only partially addressed by other techniques recently published. The method was tested on a Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene expression dataset. The results were statistically validated and compared with the relationships inferred by two machine learning approaches to gene regulatory network prediction. Furthermore, the resulting predictions were assessed using domain knowledge. The proposed algorithm may be able to accurately predict relevant biological associations between genes. One of the most relevant features of this new method is the prediction of adaptive regulation thresholds for the discretization of gene expression values, which is required prior to the rule association learning process. Moreover, an important advantage consists of its low computational cost to infer association rules. The proposed system may significantly support exploratory, large-scale studies of automated identification of potentially-relevant gene expression associations.},

  abstract = {Network analysis has been applied widely, providing a unifying language to describe disparate systems ranging from social interactions to power grids. It has recently been used in molecular biology, but so far the resulting networks have only been analysed statically. Here we present the dynamics of a biological network on a genomic scale, by integrating transcriptional regulatory information and gene-expression data for multiple conditions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We develop an approach for the statistical analysis of network dynamics, called SANDY, combining well-known global topological measures, local motifs and newly derived statistics. We uncover large changes in underlying network architecture that are unexpected given current viewpoints and random simulations. In response to diverse stimuli, transcription factors alter their interactions to varying degrees, thereby rewiring the network. A few transcription factors serve as permanent hubs, but most act transiently only during certain conditions. By studying sub-network structures, we show that environmental responses facilitate fast signal propagation (for example, with short regulatory cascades), whereas the cell cycle and sporulation direct temporal progression through multiple stages (for example, with highly inter-connected transcription factors). Indeed, to drive the latter processes forward, phase-specific transcription factors inter-regulate serially, and ubiquitously active transcription factors layer above them in a two-tiered hierarchy. We anticipate that many of the concepts presented here\textendash{}particularly the large-scale topological changes and hub transience\textendash{}will apply to other biological networks, including complex sub-systems in higher eukaryotes.},

Cells expressing the p-EMT program spatially localized to the leading edge of primary tumors. By integrating single-cell transcriptomes with bulk expression profiles for hundreds of tumors, we refined HNSCC subtypes by their malignant and stromal composition and established p-EMT as an independent predictor of nodal metastasis, grade, and adverse pathologic features.

In contrast, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has far greater mortality rate than the ALL and is most commonly affecting older adults. However, AML is a leading cause of childhood cancer mortality. In this study, we compare gene expression and molecular pathway activation patterns in three normal blood, seven pediatric ALL and seven pediatric AML bone marrow samples. We identified 172/94 and 148/31 characteristic gene expression/pathway activation signatures, clearly distinguishing pediatric ALL and AML cells, respectively, from the normal blood. The pediatric AML and ALL cells differed by 139/34 gene expression/pathway activation biomarkers. For the adult 30 AML and 17 normal blood samples, we found 132/33 gene expression/pathway AML-specific features, of which only 7/2 were common for the adult and pediatric AML and, therefore, age-independent. At the pathway level, we found more differences than similarities between the adult and pediatric forms.

Among approximately 10 million inherited DNA variations, called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), perhaps only a few thousand, will actually influence human disease risk. We have combined bioinformatics and laboratory approaches to investigate genetic variation within the p53 stress response network. p53, a prominent tumor suppressor protein, is a master regulator that targets over a hundred genes for transcriptional upregulation or repression through sequence-specific interactions with DNA response elements (REs). We identified many human genes in the network that contain SNPs in REs that can be transactivated by p53. The discovery of these individual differences has implications for variation in human responses to environmental stresses, risk of disease, and responsiveness to drug therapies. The findings also provide insight into the evolution of complex networks and the role of master regulatory genes, such as p53, in such networks.},

  abstract = {Recent genomic and biological studies of neuroblastoma have shed light on the dramatic heterogeneity in the clinical behaviour of this disease, which spans from spontaneous regression or differentiation in some patients, to relentless disease progression in others, despite intensive multimodality therapy. This evidence also suggests several possible mechanisms to explain the phenomena of spontaneous regression in neuroblastomas, including neurotrophin deprivation, humoral or cellular immunity, loss of telomerase activity and alterations in epigenetic regulation. A better understanding of the mechanisms of spontaneous regression might help to identify optimal therapeutic approaches for patients with these tumours. Currently, the most druggable mechanism is the delayed activation of developmentally programmed cell death regulated by the tropomyosin receptor kinase A pathway. Indeed, targeted therapy aimed at inhibiting neurotrophin receptors might be used in lieu of conventional chemotherapy or radiation in infants with biologically favourable tumours that require treatment. Alternative approaches consist of breaking immune tolerance to tumour antigens or activating neurotrophin receptor pathways to induce neuronal differentiation. These approaches are likely to be most effective against biologically favourable tumours, but they might also provide insights into treatment of biologically unfavourable tumours. We describe the different mechanisms of spontaneous neuroblastoma regression and the consequent therapeutic approaches.},

In a search for key regulators of metastasis in a murine breast tumor model, we have found that the transcription factor Twist, a master regulator of embryonic morphogenesis, plays an essential role in metastasis. Suppression of Twist expression in highly metastatic mammary carcinoma cells specifically inhibits their ability to metastasize from the mammary gland to the lung. Ectopic expression of Twist results in loss of E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion, activation of mesenchymal markers, and induction of cell motility, suggesting that Twist contributes to metastasis by promoting an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In human breast cancers, high level of Twist expression is correlated with invasive lobular carcinoma, a highly infiltrating tumor type associated with loss of E-cadherin expression. These results establish a mechanistic link between Twist, EMT, and tumor metastasis.},

Experimental validation shows that FOXM1 and CENPF function synergistically to promote tumor growth by coordinated regulation of target gene expression and activation of key signaling pathways associated with prostate cancer malignancy. Furthermore, co-expression of FOXM1 and CENPF is a robust prognostic indicator of poor survival and metastasis.

  abstract = {The amazing successes in cure rates for children with cancer over the last century have come in large part from identifying clinical, genetic, and molecular variables associated with response to therapy in large cooperative clinical trials and stratifying therapies according to the predicted risk of relapse. There is an expanding interest in identifying germline genomic variants, as opposed to genetic variants within the tumor, that are associated with susceptibility to toxicity and for risk of relapse. This review highlights the most important germline pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic studies in pediatric oncology. Incorporating germline genomics into risk-adapted therapies will likely lead to safer and more effective treatments for children with cancer.},

  abstract = {Systematic characterization of cancer genomes has revealed a staggering number of diverse aberrations that differ among individuals, such that the functional importance and physiological impact of most tumor genetic alterations remain poorly defined. We developed a computational framework that integrates chromosomal copy number and gene expression data for detecting aberrations that promote cancer progression. We demonstrate the utility of this framework using a melanoma data set. Our analysis correctly identified known drivers of melanoma and predicted multiple tumor dependencies. Two dependencies, TBC1D16 and RAB27A, confirmed empirically, suggest that abnormal regulation of protein trafficking contributes to proliferation in melanoma. Together, these results demonstrate the ability of integrative Bayesian approaches to identify candidate drivers with biological, and possibly therapeutic, importance in cancer.},

To highlight this resource, we present mappings of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) based on H{{\&}}E images from 13 TCGA tumor types. These TIL maps are derived through computational staining using a convolutional neural network trained to classify patches of images. Affinity propagation revealed local spatial structure in TIL patterns and correlation with overall survival. TIL map structural patterns were grouped using standard histopathological parameters. These patterns are enriched in particular T cell subpopulations derived from molecular measures. TIL densities and spatial structure were differentially enriched among tumor types, immune subtypes, and tumor molecular subtypes, implying that spatial infiltrate state could reflect particular tumor cell aberration states. Obtaining spatial lymphocytic patterns linked to the rich genomic characterization of TCGA samples demonstrates one use for the TCGA image archives with insights into the tumor-immune microenvironment.},

  abstract = {Assays of the abundance of immune cell populations in the tumor microenvironment promise to inform immune oncology research and the choice of immunotherapy for individual patients. We propose to measure the intratumoral abundance of various immune cell populations with gene expression. In contrast to IHC and flow cytometry, gene expression assays yield high information content from a clinically practical workflow. Previous studies of gene expression in purified immune cells have reported hundreds of genes showing enrichment in a single cell type, but the utility of these genes in tumor samples is unknown. We use co-expression patterns in large tumor gene expression datasets to evaluate previously reported candidate cell type marker genes lists, eliminate numerous false positives and identify a subset of high confidence marker genes. Using a novel statistical tool, we use co-expression patterns in 9986 samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to evaluate previously reported cell type marker genes. We compare immune cell scores derived from these genes to measurements from flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. We characterize the reproducibility of our cell scores in replicate runs of RNA extracted from FFPE tumor tissue. We identify a list of 60 marker genes whose expression levels measure 14 immune cell populations. Cell type scores calculated from these genes are concordant with flow cytometry and IHC readings, show high reproducibility in replicate RNA samples from FFPE tissue and enable detailed analyses of the anti-tumor immune response in TCGA. In an immunotherapy dataset, they separate responders and non-responders early on therapy and provide an intricate picture of the effects of checkpoint inhibition. Most genes previously reported to be enriched in a single cell type have co-expression patterns inconsistent with cell type specificity. Due to their concise gene set, computational simplicity and utility in tumor samples, these cell type gene signatures may be useful in future discovery research and clinical trials to understand how tumors and therapeutic intervention shape the immune response.},

  abstract = {The Hierarchical Mixture of Experts (HME) is a well-known tree-based model for regression and classification, based on soft probabilistic splits. In its original formulation it was trained by maximum likelihood, and is therefore prone to over-fitting. Furthermore the maximum likelihood framework offers no natural metric for optimizing the complexity and structure of the tree. Previous attempts to provide a Bayesian treatment of the HME model have relied either on ad-hoc local Gaussian approximations or have dealt with related models representing the joint distribution of both input and output variables. In this paper we describe a fully Bayesian treatment of the HME model based on variational inference. By combining local and global variational methods we obtain a rigourous lower bound on the marginal probability of the data under the model. This bound is optimized during the training phase, and its resulting value can be used for model order selection. We present results using this approach for a data set describing robot arm kinematics.},

Somatic tumor genome sequences provide a rich new source of data for uncovering these subtypes but have proven difficult to compare, as two tumors rarely share the same mutations. Here we introduce network-based stratification (NBS), a method to integrate somatic tumor genomes with gene networks. This approach allows for stratification of cancer into informative subtypes by clustering together patients with mutations in similar network regions. We demonstrate NBS in ovarian, uterine and lung cancer cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas. For each tissue, NBS identifies subtypes that are predictive of clinical outcomes such as patient survival, response to therapy or tumor histology. We identify network regions characteristic of each subtype and show how mutation-derived subtypes can be used to train an mRNA expression signature, which provides similar information in the absence of DNA sequence.},

  abstract = {By analyzing gene expression data in glioblastoma in combination with matched microRNA profiles, we have uncovered a posttranscriptional regulation layer of surprising magnitude, comprising more than 248,000 microRNA (miR)-mediated interactions. These include {$\sim$}7,000 genes whose transcripts act as miR "sponges" and 148 genes that act through alternative, nonsponge interactions. Biochemical analyses in cell lines confirmed that this network regulates established drivers of tumor initiation and subtype implementation, including PTEN, PDGFRA, RB1, VEGFA, STAT3, and RUNX1, suggesting that these interactions mediate crosstalk between canonical oncogenic pathways. siRNA silencing of 13 miR-mediated PTEN regulators, whose locus deletions are predictive of PTEN expression variability, was sufficient to downregulate PTEN in a 3'UTR-dependent manner and to increase tumor cell growth rates. Thus, miR-mediated interactions provide a mechanistic, experimentally validated rationale for the loss of PTEN expression in a large number of glioma samples with an intact PTEN locus.},

To define core regulatory circuitries (CRCs) controlling the gene expression program of neuroblastoma, we established and analyzed the neuroblastoma super-enhancer landscape. We discovered three types of identity in neuroblastoma cell lines: a sympathetic noradrenergic identity, defined by a CRC module including the PHOX2B, HAND2 and GATA3 transcription factors (TFs); an NCC-like identity, driven by a CRC module containing AP-1 TFs; and a mixed type, further deconvoluted at the single-cell level. Treatment of the mixed type with chemotherapeutic agents resulted in enrichment of NCC-like cells. The noradrenergic module was validated by ChIP-seq. Functional studies demonstrated dependency of neuroblastoma with noradrenergic identity on PHOX2B, evocative of lineage addiction. Most neuroblastoma primary tumors express TFs from the noradrenergic and NCC-like modules. Our data demonstrate a previously unknown aspect of tumor heterogeneity relevant for neuroblastoma treatment strategies.},

  abstract = {Primary triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), a tumour type defined by lack of oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and ERBB2 gene amplification, represent approximately 16{{\%}} of all breast cancers. Here we show in 104 TNBC cases that at the time of diagnosis these cancers exhibit a wide and continuous spectrum of genomic evolution, with some having only a handful of coding somatic aberrations in a few pathways, whereas others contain hundreds of coding somatic mutations. High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that only approximately 36{{\%}} of mutations are expressed. Using deep re-sequencing measurements of allelic abundance for 2,414 somatic mutations, we determine for the first time-to our knowledge-in an epithelial tumour subtype, the relative abundance of clonal frequencies among cases representative of the population. We show that TNBCs vary widely in their clonal frequencies at the time of diagnosis, with the basal subtype of TNBC showing more variation than non-basal TNBC. Although p53 (also known as TP53), PIK3CA and PTEN somatic mutations seem to be clonally dominant compared to other genes, in some tumours their clonal frequencies are incompatible with founder status. Mutations in cytoskeletal, cell shape and motility proteins occurred at lower clonal frequencies, suggesting that they occurred later during tumour progression. Taken together, our results show that understanding the biology and therapeutic responses of patients with TNBC will require the determination of individual tumour clonal genotypes.},

  issn = {1476-5594},
  abstract = {Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignancy of the skeleton and is prevalent in children and adolescents. Survival rates are poor and have remained stagnant owing to chemoresistance and the high propensity to form lung metastases. In this study, we used in vivo transgenic models of c-fos oncogene-induced osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma in addition to c-Fos-inducible systems in vitro to investigate downstream signalling pathways that regulate osteosarcoma growth and metastasis. Fgfr1 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 1) was identified as a novel c-Fos/activator protein-1(AP-1)-regulated gene. Induction of c-Fos in vitro in osteoblasts and chondroblasts caused an increase in Fgfr1 RNA and FGFR1 protein expression levels that resulted in increased and sustained activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), morphological transformation and increased anchorage-independent growth in response to FGF2 ligand treatment. High levels of FGFR1 protein and activated pFRS2{$\alpha$} signalling were observed in murine and human osteosarcomas. Pharmacological inhibition of FGFR1 signalling blocked MAPK activation and colony growth of osteosarcoma cells in vitro. Orthotopic injection in vivo of FGFR1-silenced osteosarcoma cells caused a marked twofold to fivefold decrease in spontaneous lung metastases. Similarly, inhibition of FGFR signalling in vivo with the small-molecule inhibitor AZD4547 markedly reduced the number and size of metastatic nodules. Thus deregulated FGFR signalling has an important role in osteoblast transformation and osteosarcoma formation and regulates the development of lung metastases. Our findings support the development of anti-FGFR inhibitors as potential antimetastatic therapy.},

  abstract = {Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common form of lymphoma in adulthood, comprises multiple biologically and clinically distinct subtypes including germinal centre B-cell-like (GCB) and activated B-cell-like (ABC) DLBCL. Gene expression profile studies have shown that its most aggressive subtype, ABC-DLBCL, is associated with constitutive activation of the NF-kappaB transcription complex. However, except for a small fraction of cases, it remains unclear whether NF-kappaB activation in these tumours represents an intrinsic program of the tumour cell of origin or a pathogenetic event. Here we show that {$>$}50{{\%}} of ABC-DLBCL and a smaller fraction of GCB-DLBCL carry somatic mutations in multiple genes, including negative (TNFAIP3, also called A20) and positive (CARD11, TRAF2, TRAF5, MAP3K7 (TAK1) and TNFRSF11A (RANK)) regulators of NF-kappaB. Of these, the A20 gene, which encodes a ubiquitin-modifying enzyme involved in termination of NF-kappaB responses, is most commonly affected, with approximately 30{{\%}} of patients displaying biallelic inactivation by mutations and/or deletions. When reintroduced in cell lines carrying biallelic inactivation of the gene, A20 induced apoptosis and cell growth arrest, indicating a tumour suppressor role. Less frequently, missense mutations of TRAF2 and CARD11 produce molecules with significantly enhanced ability to activate NF-kappaB. Thus, our results demonstrate that NF-kappaB activation in DLBCL is caused by genetic lesions affecting multiple genes, the loss or activation of which may promote lymphomagenesis by leading to abnormally prolonged NF-kappaB responses.},

  abstract = {A role for B-cell-receptor (BCR) signalling in lymphomagenesis has been inferred by studying immunoglobulin genes in human lymphomas and by engineering mouse models, but genetic and functional evidence for its oncogenic role in human lymphomas is needed. Here we describe a form of 'chronic active' BCR signalling that is required for cell survival in the activated B-cell-like (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The signalling adaptor CARD11 is required for constitutive NF-kappaB pathway activity and survival in ABC DLBCL. Roughly 10{{\%}} of ABC DLBCLs have mutant CARD11 isoforms that activate NF-kappaB, but the mechanism that engages wild-type CARD11 in other ABC DLBCLs was unknown. An RNA interference genetic screen revealed that a BCR signalling component, Bruton's tyrosine kinase, is essential for the survival of ABC DLBCLs with wild-type CARD11. In addition, knockdown of proximal BCR subunits (IgM, Ig-kappa, CD79A and CD79B) killed ABC DLBCLs with wild-type CARD11 but not other lymphomas. The BCRs in these ABC DLBCLs formed prominent clusters in the plasma membrane with low diffusion, similarly to BCRs in antigen-stimulated normal B cells. Somatic mutations affecting the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) signalling modules of CD79B and CD79A were detected frequently in ABC DLBCL biopsy samples but rarely in other DLBCLs and never in Burkitt's lymphoma or mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. In 18{{\%}} of ABC DLBCLs, one functionally critical residue of CD79B, the first ITAM tyrosine, was mutated. These mutations increased surface BCR expression and attenuated Lyn kinase, a feedback inhibitor of BCR signalling. These findings establish chronic active BCR signalling as a new pathogenetic mechanism in ABC DLBCL, suggesting several therapeutic strategies.},

  abstract = {Influenza vaccines must be updated regularly because influenza viruses continuously acquire mutations in antibody binding sites of hemagglutinin (HA). The majority of H3N2 strains circulating in the Northern Hemisphere during the 2014-2015 season are antigenically mismatched to the A/Texas/50/2012 H3N2 vaccine strain. Recent H3N2 strains possess several new HA mutations, and it is unknown which of these mutations contribute to the 2014-2015 vaccine mismatch. Here, we use reverse genetics to demonstrate that mutations in HA antigenic site B are primarily responsible for the current mismatch. Sera isolated from vaccinated humans and infected ferrets and sheep had reduced hemagglutination inhibition and in vitro neutralization titers against reverse-genetics-derived viruses possessing mutations in the HA antigenic site B. These data provide an antigenic explanation for the low influenza vaccine efficacy observed during the 2014-2015 influenza season. Furthermore, our data support the World Health Organization's decision to update the H3N2 component of future vaccine formulations.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION Molecule-based prediction of drug response is one major task of precision oncology. Recently, large-scale cancer genomic studies, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), provide the opportunity to evaluate the predictive utility of molecular data for clinical drug responses in multiple cancer types. RESULTS Here, we first curated the drug treatment information from TCGA. Four chemotherapeutic drugs had more than 180 clinical response records. Then, we developed a computational framework to evaluate the molecule based predictions of clinical responses of the four drugs and to identify the corresponding molecular signatures. Results show that mRNA or miRNA expressions can predict drug responses significantly better than random classifiers in specific cancer types. A few signature genes are involved in drug response related pathways, such as DDB1 in DNA repair pathway and DLL4 in Notch signaling pathway. Finally, we applied the framework to predict responses across multiple cancer types and found that the prediction performances get improved for cisplatin based on miRNA expressions. Integrative analysis of clinical drug response data and molecular data offers opportunities for discovering predictive markers in cancer. This study provides a starting point to objectively evaluate the molecule-based predictions of clinical drug responses.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION Drug toxicity often goes undetected until clinical trials, which are the most costly and dangerous phase of drug development. Both the cultures of human cells and animal studies have limitations that cannot be overcome by incremental improvements in drug-testing protocols. A new generation of bioengineered tumors is now emerging in response to these limitations, with potential to transform drug screening by providing predictive models of tumors within their tissue context, for studies of drug safety and efficacy. An area that could greatly benefit from these models is cancer research. AREAS COVERED In this review, the authors first describe the engineered tumor systems, using Ewing's sarcoma as an example of human tumor that cannot be predictably studied in cell culture and animal models. Then, they discuss the importance of the tissue context for cancer progression and outline the biomimetic principles for engineering human tumors. Finally, they discuss the utility of bioengineered tumor models for cancer research and address the challenges in modeling human tumors for use in drug discovery and testing. EXPERT OPINION While tissue models are just emerging as a new tool for cancer drug discovery, they are already demonstrating potential for recapitulating, in vitro, the native behavior of human tumors. Still, numerous challenges need to be addressed before we can have platforms with a predictive power appropriate for the pharmaceutical industry. Some of the key needs include the incorporation of the vascular compartment, immune system components, and mechanical signals that regulate tumor development and function.},

We also observed a continuum of stemness-related expression states that enabled us to identify putative regulators of stemness in vivo. Finally, we show that established glioblastoma subtype classifiers are variably expressed across individual cells within a tumor and demonstrate the potential prognostic implications of such intratumoral heterogeneity.

We focus on known protein complexes that have clearly defined interactions between their subunits. We find that subunits of the same protein complex show significant coexpression, both in terms of similarities of absolute mRNA levels and expression profiles, e.g., we can often see subunits of a complex having correlated patterns of expression over a time course. We classify the yeast protein complexes as either permanent or transient, with permanent ones being maintained through most cellular conditions. We find that, generally, permanent complexes, such as the ribosome and proteasome, have a particularly strong relationship with expression, while transient ones do not. However, we note that several transient complexes, such as the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme and the replication complex, can be subdivided into smaller permanent ones, which do have a strong relationship to gene expression. We also investigated the interactions in aggregated, genome-wide data sets, such as the comprehensive yeast two-hybrid experiments, and found them to have only a weak relationship with gene expression, similar to that of transient complexes.

Cell lines derived from neuroblastoma (a neural-crest tumor) exhibit at least 2 distinct morphological cell types, a neuroblastic phenotype (N-type) and an epithelial-like phenotype (S-type) with characteristics of substrate-adhesiveness. We have analyzed 17 human neuroblastoma cell lines using a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against cytoskeletal proteins. Three neuroblastoma cell lines (KP-N-SI, KP-N-YN and SMS-KCN) bound an alpha-smooth-muscle actin antibody. In addition, one of these lines (KP-N-SI) bound anti-desmin MAbs as determined by indirect immunofluorescence. A total of 8 cloned cell lines were obtained from the above parent cell lines. These were composed of either N- or S-type cells and were confirmed to have the same neuroblastoma origin as each parent cell line by chromosomal analysis. Alpha-smooth-muscle actin and desmin were demonstrated in the S-type cloned cells by indirect immunofluorescence, as well as by 2-dimensional Western blot analysis. These results were confirmed by Northern blot analysis using a specific probe (pSH alpha SMA-3' UT) to human alpha-smooth-muscle actin mRNA. These ascertain the presence of alpha-smooth-muscle actin and desmin in neuroblastoma cell lines. These data show that, in addition to giving rise to cells with neural, Schwann-cell and melanocyte markers, neuroblastoma can also give rise to the cells expressing smooth-muscle cell markers.},

  issn = {1474-760X},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND A systems biology approach based on the assembly and interrogation of gene regulatory networks, or interactomes, was used to study neuroadaptation processes associated with the transition to alcohol dependence at the molecular level. RESULTS Using a rat model of dependent and non-dependent alcohol self-administration, we reverse engineered a global transcriptional regulatory network during protracted abstinence, a period when relapse rates are highest. We then interrogated the network to identify master regulator genes that mechanistically regulate brain region-specific signatures associated with dependent and non-dependent alcohol self-administration. Among these, the gene coding for the glucocorticoid receptor was independently identified as a master regulator in multiple brain regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, central nucleus of the amygdala, and ventral tegmental area, consistent with the view that brain reward and stress systems are dysregulated during protracted abstinence. Administration of the glucocorticoid antagonist mifepristone in either the nucleus accumbens or ventral tegmental area selectively decreased dependent, excessive, alcohol self-administration in rats but had no effect on non-dependent, moderate, alcohol self-administration. CONCLUSIONS Our study suggests that assembly and analysis of regulatory networks is an effective strategy for the identification of key regulators of long-term neuroplastic changes within specific brain regions that play a functional role in alcohol dependence. More specifically, our results support a key role for regulatory networks downstream of the glucocorticoid receptor in excessive alcohol drinking during protracted alcohol abstinence.},

They have been recognized as a promising tool for diagnosing, subtyping and treating cancers. RNA-seq has become a precise and efficient standard for genome-wide screening of such aberration events. Many fusion transcript detection algorithms have been developed for paired-end RNA-seq data but their performance has not been comprehensively evaluated to guide practitioners. In this paper, we evaluated 15 popular algorithms by their precision and recall trade-off, accuracy of supporting reads and computational cost. We further combine top-performing methods for improved ensemble detection. RESULTS Fifteen fusion transcript detection tools were compared using three synthetic data sets under different coverage, read length, insert size and background noise, and three real data sets with selected experimental validations. No single method dominantly performed the best but SOAPfuse generally performed well, followed by FusionCatcher and JAFFA. We further demonstrated the potential of a meta-caller algorithm by combining top performing methods to re-prioritize candidate fusion transcripts with high confidence that can be followed by experimental validation.

TNF inhibitors are being used for a variety of indications in children including Crohn's disease and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. However, the full safety profile of these agents is still not known. In adult patients, TNF inhibitors have demonstrated a variety of adverse effects including increased risk of infection, malignancy, demyelinating disorders, and reactivation of latent diseases. In children the rate of adverse effects is harder to elucidate due to the limited number of patients in clinical trials and limited case reports. However, based on the data available, TNF inhibitors have been implicated in increasing the rate of malignancy in children, especially the rate of lymphoma. In addition, similarly with adults the rate of infections is increased and the types of infections are more rare or opportunistic. One of the more common adverse effects continues to be infusion or injection-site reactions, although children tend to have a lower rate of infusion reactions with infliximab compared to adults. Based on the limited safety information and long-term effect data, TNF inhibitors should be reserved in children for patients with refractory disease and the risks need to be understood and assessed prior to initiation.},

  volume = {10},
  issn = {1756-0500},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND Nephroblastoma and neuroblastoma belong to the most common abdominal malignancies in childhood. Similarities in the initial presentation may provide difficulties in distinguishing between these two entities, especially if unusual variations to prevalent patterns of disease manifestation occur. Because of the risk of tumor rupture, European protocols do not require biopsy for diagnosis, which leads to misdiagnosis in some cases. CASE PRESENTATION We report on a 4\textonehalf{}-year-old girl with a renal tumor displaying radiological and laboratory characteristics supporting the diagnosis of nephroblastoma. Imaging studies showed tumor extension into the inferior vena cava and bilateral lung metastases while urine catecholamines and MIBG-scintigraphy were negative. Preoperative chemotherapy with vincristine, actinomycine D and adriamycin according to the SIOP2001/GPOH protocol for the treatment of nephroblastoma was initiated and followed by surgical tumor resection. Histopathology revealed an undifferentiated tumor with expression of neuronal markers, suggestive of neuroblastoma. MYCN amplification could not be detected. DNA-microarray analysis was performed using Affymetrix genechip human genome U133 plus 2.0 and artificial neural network analysis. Results were confirmed by multiplex RT-PCR. RESULTS Principal component analysis using 84 genes showed that the patient sample was clearly clustering with neuroblastoma tumors. This was confirmed by hierarchical clustering of the multiplex RT-PCR data. The patient underwent treatment for high-risk neuroblastoma comprising chemotherapy including cisplatin, etoposide, vindesine, dacarbacine, ifosfamide, vincristine, adriamycine and autologous stem cell transplantation followed by maintenance therapy with 13-cis retinoic acid (GPOH NB2004 High Risk Trial Protocol) and is in complete long-term remission. CONCLUSION The use of gene expression profiling in an individual patient strongly contributed to clarification in a diagnostic dilemma which finally led to a change of diagnosis from nephroblastoma to neuroblastoma. This case underlines the importance of gene-expression profiling in the correct diagnosis of childhood neoplasms with atypical presentation to ensure that adequate treatment regimens can be applied.},

Recombinant cytokines (i.e., IL-15 and IL-2), antibodies blocking inhibitory receptors (i.e., KIR, NKG2A and TIGIT) and agonists delivering signals via CD137, NKG2D and CD16 stand out as the most suitable opportunities. These agents can be used to potentiate NKcell- mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against antibody-coated tumor cells, offering potential for multiple combinatorial immunotherapy strategies against cancer.},

  abstract = {Using whole exome sequencing to predict aberrations in tumours is a cost effective alternative to whole genome sequencing, however is predominantly used for variant detection and infrequently utilised for detection of somatic copy number variation. We propose a new method to infer copy number and genotypes using whole exome data from paired tumour/normal samples. Our algorithm uses two Hidden Markov Models to predict copy number and genotypes and computationally resolves polyploidy/aneuploidy, normal cell contamination and signal baseline shift. Our method makes explicit detection on chromosome arm level events, which are commonly found in tumour samples. The methods are combined into a package named ADTEx (Aberration Detection in Tumour Exome). We applied our algorithm to a cohort of 17 in-house generated and 18 TCGA paired ovarian cancer/normal exomes and evaluated the performance by comparing against the copy number variations and genotypes predicted using Affymetrix SNP 6.0 data of the same samples. Further, we carried out a comparison study to show that ADTEx outperformed its competitors in terms of precision and F-measure. Our proposed method, ADTEx, uses both depth of coverage ratios and B allele frequencies calculated from whole exome sequencing data, to predict copy number variations along with their genotypes. ADTEx is implemented as a user friendly software package using Python and R statistical language.

Using experiments on synthetic data, we demonstrate that pathway-guided results maintain, and often improve, the accuracy of predictors even in cases where the full gene network is unknown. We apply the method to predict the drug response of breast cancer cell lines. GELnet is able to reveal genetic determinants of sensitivity and resistance for several compounds.

Tumours progress very quickly following RB1 inactivation but the underlying mechanism is not known. Here we show that the retinoblastoma genome is stable, but that multiple cancer pathways can be epigenetically deregulated. To identify the mutations that cooperate with RB1 loss, we performed whole-genome sequencing of retinoblastomas. The overall mutational rate was very low; RB1 was the only known cancer gene mutated. We then evaluated the role of RB1 in genome stability and considered non-genetic mechanisms of cancer pathway deregulation. For example, the proto-oncogene SYK is upregulated in retinoblastoma and is required for tumour cell survival. Targeting SYK with a small-molecule inhibitor induced retinoblastoma tumour cell death in vitro and in vivo. Thus, retinoblastomas may develop quickly as a result of the epigenetic deregulation of key cancer pathways as a direct or indirect result of RB1 loss.},

  abstract = {Inflammation is associated with the development and malignant progression of most cancers. As most of the cell types involved in cancer-associated inflammation are genetically stable and thus are not subjected to rapid emergence of drug resistance, the targeting of inflammation represents an attractive strategy both for cancer prevention and for cancer therapy. Tumor-extrinsic inflammation is caused by many factors, including bacterial and viral infections, autoimmune diseases, obesity, tobacco smoking, asbestos exposure, and excessive alcohol consumption, all of which increase cancer risk and stimulate malignant progression. In contrast, cancer-intrinsic or cancer-elicited inflammation can be triggered by cancer-initiating mutations and can contribute to malignant progression through the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells. Both extrinsic and intrinsic inflammation can result in immunosuppression, thereby providing a preferred background for tumor development. In clinical trials, lifestyle modifications including healthy diet, exercise, alcohol, and smoking cessation have proven effective in ameliorating inflammation and reducing the risk of cancer-related deaths. In addition, consumption of certain anti-inflammatory drugs, including aspirin, can significantly reduce cancer risk, suggesting that common nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) and more specific COX2 inhibitors can be used in cancer prevention. In addition to being examined for their preventative potential, both NSAIDs and more potent anti-inflammatory antibody-based drugs need to be tested for their ability to augment the efficacy of more conventional therapeutic approaches on the basis of tumor resection, radiation, and cytotoxic chemicals.

  abstract = {Improvements in survival for Ewing sarcoma pediatric and adolescent patients have been modest over the past 20 years. Combinations of anticancer agents endure as an option to overcome resistance to single treatments caused by compensatory pathways. Moreover, combinations are thought to lessen any associated adverse side effects through reduced dosing, which is particularly important in childhood tumors. Using a parallel phenotypic combinatorial screening approach of cells derived from three pediatric tumor types, we identified Ewing sarcoma-specific interactions of a diverse set of targeted agents including approved drugs. We were able to retrieve highly synergistic drug combinations specific for Ewing sarcoma and identified signaling processes important for Ewing sarcoma cell proliferation determined by EWS-FLI1 We generated a molecular target profile of PKC412, a multikinase inhibitor with strong synergistic propensity in Ewing sarcoma, revealing its targets in critical Ewing sarcoma signaling routes. Using a multilevel experimental approach including quantitative phosphoproteomics, we analyzed the molecular rationale behind the disease-specific synergistic effect of simultaneous application of PKC412 and IGF1R inhibitors. The mechanism of the drug synergy between these inhibitors is different from the sum of the mechanisms of the single agents. The combination effectively inhibited pathway crosstalk and averted feedback loop repression, in EWS-FLI1-dependent manner. Mol Cancer Ther; 16(1); 88-101. \textcopyright{}2016 AACR.},

  abstract = {Patients with many advanced solid cancers have very poor prognosis, and improvements in life expectancy are measured only in months. We have recently reported the remarkable clinical outcome of a patient with advanced, gemcitabine-resistant, pancreatic cancer who was later treated with DNA-damaging agents, on the basis of the observation of significant activity of this class of drugs against a personalized tumorgraft generated from the patient's surgically resected tumor. Here, we extend the approach to patients with other advanced cancers. Tumors resected from 14 patients with refractory advanced cancers were propagated in immunodeficient mice and treated with 63 drugs in 232 treatment regimens. An effective treatment regimen in the xenograft model was identified for 12 patients. One patient died before receiving treatment, and the remaining 11 patients received 17 prospectively guided treatments. Fifteen of these treatments resulted in durable partial remissions. In 2 subjects, no effective treatments were found. Overall, there was a remarkable correlation between drug activity in the model and clinical outcome, both in terms of resistance and sensitivity. The data support the use of the personalized tumorgraft model as a powerful investigational platform for therapeutic decision making and to efficiently guide cancer treatment in the clinic.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION In recent years, vast advances in biomedical technologies and comprehensive sequencing have revealed the genomic landscape of common forms of human cancer in unprecedented detail. The broad heterogeneity of the disease calls for rapid development of personalized therapies. Translating the readily available genomic data into useful knowledge that can be applied in the clinic remains a challenge. Computational methods are needed to aid these efforts by robustly analyzing genome-scale data from distinct experimental platforms for prioritization of targets and treatments. RESULTS We propose a novel, biologically-motivated, Bayesian multitask approach, which explicitly models gene-centric dependencies across multiple and distinct genomic platforms. We introduce a genewise prior and present a fully Bayesian formulation of a group factor analysis model. In supervised prediction applications, our multitask approach leverages similarities in response profiles of groups of drugs that are more likely to be related to true biological signal, which leads to more robust performance and improved generalization ability. We evaluate the performance of our method on molecularly characterized collections of cell lines profiled against two compound panels, namely the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and the Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal. We demonstrate that accounting for the gene-centric dependencies enables leveraging information from multi-omic input data and improves prediction and feature selection performance. We further demonstrate the applicability of our method in an unsupervised dimensionality reduction application by inferring genes essential to tumorigenesis in the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma patient cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas.

  abstract = {Family history of lymphoid neoplasm (LN) is a strong and consistently observed Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) risk factor, although it has been only marginally examined in pediatric/adolescent patients. Here, healthy control children identified by random digit dialing were matched on sex, race/ethnicity and age to HL cases diagnosed at 0-14 years at Children's Oncology Group institutions in 1989-2003. Detailed histories were captured by structured telephone interviews with parents of 517 cases and 783 controls. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) RNA detection was performed for 355 available case tumors. Two analytic strategies were applied to estimate associations between family cancer history and pediatric/adolescent HL. In a standard case-control approach, multivariate conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios and 95{{\%}} confidence intervals (CIs). In a reconstructed cohort approach, each relative was included as a separate observation, and multivariate proportional hazards regression was used to produce hazard ratios (HRs) and 95{{\%}} CIs. Using the latter, pediatric/adolescent HL was associated with a positive family history (HR = 1.20, 95{{\%}} CI: 1.06-1.36), particularly early-onset cancers (HR = 1.30, 95{{\%}} CI: 1.06-1.59) and those in the paternal lineage (HR = 1.38, 95{{\%}} CI: 1.16-1.65), with a suggested association for LN in first-degree relatives (HR = 3.61, 95{{\%}} CI: 0.87-15.01). There were no discernable patterns for EBV+ versus EBV- HL. The clustering of LN within pedigrees may signal shared genetic susceptibility or common environmental exposures. Heritable genetic risk variants have only recently begun to be discovered, however. These results are consistent with other studies and provide a compelling rationale for family-based studies to garner information about genetic susceptibility to HL.},

The impact of PGE(2) reflects the balance between its cyclooxygenase 2-regulated synthesis and 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase-driven degradation and the pattern of expression of PGE(2) receptors. PGE(2) enhances its own production but suppresses acute inflammatory mediators, resulting in its predominance at late/chronic stages of immunity. PGE(2) supports activation of dendritic cells but suppresses their ability to attract naive, memory, and effector T cells. PGE(2) selectively suppresses effector functions of macrophages and neutrophils and the Th1-, CTL-, and NK cell-mediated type 1 immunity, but it promotes Th2, Th17, and regulatory T cell responses. PGE(2) modulates chemokine production, inhibiting the attraction of proinflammatory cells while enhancing local accumulation of regulatory T cells cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells.

We apply our approach to data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and test model predictions experimentally. We find that mutations mapping to phosphoproteins often create new interactions but that mutations altering SH2 domains result almost exclusively in loss of interactions. Some of these mutations eliminate all interactions, but many cause more selective loss, thereby rewiring specific edges in highly connected subnetworks. Moreover, idiosyncratic mutations appear to be as functionally consequential as recurrent mutations. By synthesizing genomic, structural and biochemical data, our framework represents a new approach to the interpretation of genetic variation.},

Pathway elements are complex entities such as protein complexes, gene family members and chemical compounds. The conversion of pathway topology to a gene/protein networks (where nodes are a simple element like a gene/protein) is a critical and challenging task that enables topology-based gene set analyses. Unfortunately, currently available R/Bioconductor packages provide pathway networks only from single databases. They do not propagate signals through chemical compounds and do not differentiate between complexes and gene families. Here we present graphite, a Bioconductor package addressing these issues. Pathway information from four different databases is interpreted following specific biologically-driven rules that allow the reconstruction of gene-gene networks taking into account protein complexes, gene families and sensibly removing chemical compounds from the final graphs. The resulting networks represent a uniform resource for pathway analyses. Indeed, graphite provides easy access to three recently proposed topological methods. The graphite package is available as part of the Bioconductor software suite. graphite is an innovative package able to gather and make easily available the contents of the four major pathway databases. In the field of topological analysis graphite acts as a provider of biological information by reducing the pathway complexity considering the biological meaning of the pathway elements.},

Despite intensive chemotherapy, 20{{\%}} of pediatric patients and over 50{{\%}} of adult patients with ALL do not achieve a complete remission or relapse after intensified chemotherapy, making disease relapse and resistance to therapy the most substantial challenge in the treatment of this disease. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identify mutations in the cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II gene (NT5C2), which encodes a 5'-nucleotidase enzyme that is responsible for the inactivation of nucleoside-analog chemotherapy drugs, in 20/103 (19{{\%}}) relapse T cell ALLs and 1/35 (3{{\%}}) relapse B-precursor ALLs. NT5C2 mutant proteins show increased nucleotidase activity in vitro and conferred resistance to chemotherapy with 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine when expressed in ALL lymphoblasts. These results support a prominent role for activating mutations in NT5C2 and increased nucleoside-analog metabolism in disease progression and chemotherapy resistance in ALL.},

Here we sequence 633 genes, encoding the majority of known epigenetic regulatory proteins, in over 1,000 paediatric tumours to define the landscape of somatic mutations in epigenetic regulators in paediatric cancer. Our results demonstrate a marked variation in the frequency of gene mutations across 21 different paediatric cancer subtypes, with the highest frequency of mutations detected in high-grade gliomas, T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and medulloblastoma, and a paucity of mutations in low-grade glioma and retinoblastoma. The most frequently mutated genes are H3F3A, PHF6, ATRX, KDM6A, SMARCA4, ASXL2, CREBBP, EZH2, MLL2, USP7, ASXL1, NSD2, SETD2, SMC1A and ZMYM3. We identify novel loss-of-function mutations in the ubiquitin-specific processing protease 7 (USP7) in paediatric leukaemia, which result in decreased deubiquitination activity. Collectively, our results help to define the landscape of mutations in epigenetic regulatory genes in paediatric cancer and yield a valuable new database for investigating the role of epigenetic dysregulations in cancer.},

Here we describe a computational platform that integrates the analysis of copy number variations and somatic mutations and unravels the landscape of in-frame gene fusions in glioblastoma. We found mutations with loss of heterozygosity in LZTR1, encoding an adaptor of CUL3-containing E3 ligase complexes. Mutations and deletions disrupt LZTR1 function, which restrains the self renewal and growth of glioma spheres that retain stem cell features. Loss-of-function mutations in CTNND2 target a neural-specific gene and are associated with the transformation of glioma cells along the very aggressive mesenchymal phenotype. We also report recurrent translocations that fuse the coding sequence of EGFR to several partners, with EGFR-SEPT14 being the most frequent functional gene fusion in human glioblastoma. EGFR-SEPT14 fusions activate STAT3 signaling and confer mitogen independence and sensitivity to EGFR inhibition. These results provide insights into the pathogenesis of glioblastoma and highlight new targets for therapeutic intervention.},

  abstract = {Previously undescribed prognostic subclasses of high-grade astrocytoma are identified and discovered to resemble stages in neurogenesis. One tumor class displaying neuronal lineage markers shows longer survival, while two tumor classes enriched for neural stem cell markers display equally short survival. Poor prognosis subclasses exhibit markers either of proliferation or of angiogenesis and mesenchyme. Upon recurrence, tumors frequently shift toward the mesenchymal subclass. Chromosomal locations of genes distinguishing tumor subclass parallel DNA copy number differences between subclasses. Functional relevance of tumor subtype molecular signatures is suggested by the ability of cell line signatures to predict neurosphere growth. A robust two-gene prognostic model utilizing PTEN and DLL3 expression suggests that Akt and Notch signaling are hallmarks of poor prognosis versus better prognosis gliomas, respectively.},

Induction of ectopic sim protein under the control of the hsp70 promoter shows that sim can direct cells of the lateral CNS to exhibit midline cell morphology and patterns of gene expression.

  volume = {13},
  issn = {1471-2164},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND Despite initial response in adjuvant chemotherapy, ovarian cancer patients treated with the combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin frequently suffer from recurrence after few cycles of treatment, and the underlying mechanisms causing the chemoresistance remain unclear. Recently, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) research network concluded an ovarian cancer study and released the dataset to the public. The TCGA dataset possesses large sample size, comprehensive molecular profiles, and clinical outcome information; however, because of the unknown molecular subtypes in ovarian cancer and the great diversity of adjuvant treatments TCGA patients went through, studying chemotherapeutic response using the TCGA data is difficult. Additionally, factors such as sample batches, patient ages, and tumor stages further confound or suppress the identification of relevant genes, and thus the biological functions and disease mechanisms. RESULTS To address these issues, herein we propose an analysis procedure designed to reduce suppression effect by focusing on a specific chemotherapeutic treatment, and to remove confounding effects such as batch effect, patient's age, and tumor stages. The proposed procedure starts with a batch effect adjustment, followed by a rigorous sample selection process. Then, the gene expression, copy number, and methylation profiles from the TCGA ovarian cancer dataset are analyzed using a semi-supervised clustering method combined with a novel scoring function. As a result, two molecular classifications, one with poor copy number profiles and one with poor methylation profiles, enriched with unfavorable scores are identified. Compared with the samples enriched with favorable scores, these two classifications exhibit poor progression-free survival (PFS) and might be associated with poor chemotherapy response specifically to the combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin. Significant genes and biological processes are detected subsequently using classical statistical approaches and enrichment analysis. CONCLUSIONS The proposed procedure for the reduction of confounding and suppression effects and the semi-supervised clustering method are essential steps to identify genes associated with the chemotherapeutic response.},

  abstract = {The immune system has many important regulatory roles in cancer development and progression. Given the emergence of effective immune therapies against many cancers, reliable predictors of response are needed. One method of determining response is by evaluating immune cell populations from treated and untreated tumor samples. The amount of material obtained from tumor biopsies can be limited; therefore, gene-based or protein-based analyses may be attractive because they require minimal tissue. Cell-specific signatures are being analyzed with use of the latest technologies, including NanoString's nCounter technology, intracellular staining flow cytometry, cytometry by time-of-flight, RNA-Seq, and barcoding antibody-based protein arrays. These signatures provide information about the contributions of specific types of immune cells to bulk tumor samples. To date, both tumor tissue and immune cells have been analyzed for molecular expression profiles that can assess genes and proteins that are specific to immune cells, yielding results of varying specificity. Here, we discuss the importance of profiling tumor tissue and immune cells to identify immune-cell-associated genes and proteins and specific gene profiles of immune cells. We also discuss the use of these signatures in cancer treatment and the challenges faced in molecular expression profiling of immune cell populations.},

In contrast, MYC expression was almost exclusively found in the MYCN-NA tumors (9 of 20) especially when they had PN (8 of 11). Those patients with only MYC-positive tumors had the worst EFS (N=8, 12.5{{\%}} {$\pm$} 11.7{{\%}}) compared with only MYCN-positive (N=39, 49.9{{\%}} {$\pm$} 17.7{{\%}}) and both negative tumors (N=15, 70.0{{\%}} {$\pm$} 17.1{{\%}}) (P= .0029). High MKI was often found in only MYCN-positive (30 of 38) but rarely in only MYC-positive (2 of 8) tumors. CONCLUSIONS NBUD represents a unique subtype of neuroblastoma associated with a poor prognosis. In this subtype, MYC protein expression may be a new prognostic factor indicating more aggressive clinical behavior than MYCN amplification and subsequent MYCN protein expression.},

PDX models mostly retain the principal histologic and genetic characteristics of their donor tumor and remain stable across passages. These models have been shown to be predictive of clinical outcomes and are being used for preclinical drug evaluation, biomarker identification, biologic studies, and personalized medicine strategies. This article summarizes the current state of the art in this field, including methodologic issues, available collections, practical applications, challenges and shortcomings, and future directions, and introduces a European consortium of PDX models. SIGNIFICANCE PDX models are increasingly used in translational cancer research. These models are useful for drug screening, biomarker development, and the preclinical evaluation of personalized medicine strategies.

Specifically, whole-exome sequencing using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies is gaining popularity in the human genetics community due to the moderate costs, manageable data amounts and straightforward interpretation of analysis results. While whole-exome and, in the near future, whole-genome sequencing are becoming commodities, data analysis still poses significant challenges and led to the development of a plethora of tools supporting specific parts of the analysis workflow or providing a complete solution. Here, we surveyed 205 tools for whole-genome/whole-exome sequencing data analysis supporting five distinct analytical steps: quality assessment, alignment, variant identification, variant annotation and visualization. We report an overview of the functionality, features and specific requirements of the individual tools. We then selected 32 programs for variant identification, variant annotation and visualization, which were subjected to hands-on evaluation using four data sets: one set of exome data from two patients with a rare disease for testing identification of germline mutations, two cancer data sets for testing variant callers for somatic mutations, copy number variations and structural variations, and one semi-synthetic data set for testing identification of copy number variations. Our comprehensive survey and evaluation of NGS tools provides a valuable guideline for human geneticists working on Mendelian disorders, complex diseases and cancers.},

However, gleaning biological insight from the long lists of genes generated by microarray analysis remains a significant challenge. In this issue of PNAS, Subramanian et al. (1) describe and validate gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), a computational method that helps rapidly connect gene expression with biology and promises to be a valuable addition to publicly available computational resources.

Early on, investigators adapted unsupervised computational methods such as hierarchical clustering (2) and self-organized maps (3) to arrange genes and samples in groups or clusters based solely on the similarity of their gene expression. These methods successfully revealed the orchestrated gene expression underlying basic cellular processes such as yeast replication (4), fibroblast cell proliferation (5), and hematopoietic differentiation (3), and they continue to be used widely today. Unsupervised methods are unbiased and remain important tools for class discovery.

Alternatively, supervised methods of analysis use sample classifiers along with gene expression to rapidly identify hypothesis-driven correlations (i.e., tumor v. normal, pathological grade, recurrent disease, histological category, etc.). A few examples of supervised methods of analysis include significance analysis of microarray (SAM) (6), class prediction (7), support vector machines (8), and probit regression analysis (9, 10). In the field of oncology, supervised methods of gene expression have successfully identified novel marker genes for diagnosis (11), prognosis (12), and therapeutic response (13). Supervised methods can help overcome obfuscating technical or biological variation in gene expression and continue to identify important associations between sample phenotypes and gene expression.

GSEA represents an innovative method of supervised analysis. This analysis is performed by ( i ) ranking all genes in the data set based on their correlation to the chosen phenotype, ( ii ) identifying the rank positions of all members of the gene \ldots{}},

Deciphering the hidden patterns in gene expression data proffers a prodigious preference to strengthen the understanding of functional genomics. The complexity of biological networks and the volume of genes present increase the challenges of comprehending and interpretation of the resulting mass of data, which consists of millions of measurements; these data also inhibit vagueness, imprecision, and noise. Therefore, the use of clustering techniques is a first step toward addressing these challenges, which is essential in the data mining process to reveal natural structures and identify interesting patterns in the underlying data. The clustering of gene expression data has been proven to be useful in making known the natural structure inherent in gene expression data, understanding gene functions, cellular processes, and subtypes of cells, mining useful information from noisy data, and understanding gene regulation. The other benefit of clustering gene expression data is the identification of homology, which is very important in vaccine design. This review examines the various clustering algorithms applicable to the gene expression data in order to discover and provide useful knowledge of the appropriate clustering technique that will guarantee stability and high degree of accuracy in its analysis procedure.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: The use of DNA microarrays has become quite popular in many scientific and medical disciplines, such as in cancer research. One common goal of these studies is to determine which genes are differentially expressed between cancer and healthy tissue, or more generally, between two experimental conditions. A major complication in the molecular profiling of tumors using gene expression data is that the data represent a combination of tumor and normal cells. Much of the methodology developed for assessing differential expression with microarray data has assumed that tissue samples are homogeneous.
RESULTS: In this paper, we outline a general framework for determining differential expression in the presence of mixed cell populations. We consider study designs in which paired tissues and unpaired tissues are available. A hierarchical mixture model is used for modeling the data; a combination of methods of moments procedures and the expectation-maximization algorithm are used to estimate the model parameters. The finite-sample properties of the methods are assessed in simulation studies; they are applied to two microarray datasets from cancer studies.

Most of the methods ranked high the gene sets designed for specific diseases whenever samples from affected individuals were compared against controls via microarrays. The top methods for gene set prioritization were different from the top ones in terms of sensitivity, and four of the sixteen methods had large false positives rates assessed by permuting the phenotype of the samples. The best overall methods among those that generated reasonably low false positive rates, when permuting phenotypes, were PLAGE, GLOBALTEST, and PADOG. The best method in the category that generated higher than expected false positives was MRGSE.},

  abstract = {Gene expression measurements have successfully been used for building prognostic signatures, i.e for identifying a short list of important genes that can predict patient outcome. Mostly microarray measurements have been considered, and there is little advice available for building multivariable risk prediction models from RNA-Seq data. We specifically consider penalized regression techniques, such as the lasso and componentwise boosting, which can simultaneously consider all measurements and provide both, multivariable regression models for prediction and automated variable selection. However, they might be affected by the typical skewness, mean-variance-dependency or extreme values of RNA-Seq covariates and therefore could benefit from transformations of the latter. In an analytical part, we highlight preferential selection of covariates with large variances, which is problematic due to the mean-variance dependency of RNA-Seq data. In a simulation study, we compare different transformations of RNA-Seq data for potentially improving detection of important genes. Specifically, we consider standardization, the log transformation, a variance-stabilizing transformation, the Box-Cox transformation, and rank-based transformations. In addition, the prediction performance for real data from patients with kidney cancer and acute myeloid leukemia is considered. We show that signature size, identification performance, and prediction performance critically depend on the choice of a suitable transformation. Rank-based transformations perform well in all scenarios and can even outperform complex variance-stabilizing approaches. Generally, the results illustrate that the distribution and potential transformations of RNA-Seq data need to be considered as a critical step when building risk prediction models by penalized regression techniques.},

ESTIMATE scores correlate with DNA copy number-based tumour purity across samples from 11 different tumour types, profiled on Agilent, Affymetrix platforms or based on RNA sequencing and available through The Cancer Genome Atlas. The prediction accuracy is further corroborated using 3,809 transcriptional profiles available elsewhere in the public domain. The ESTIMATE method allows consideration of tumour-associated normal cells in genomic and transcriptomic studies. An R-library is available on https://sourceforge.net/projects/estimateproject/.},

Once detected, T cells become activated and either directly kill the infected / transformed cells (CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes) or orchestrate the activation of the adaptive immune response (CD4+ T cells). The immune surveillance of transformed/tumour cells drives alteration of the antigen processing and presentation pathways to evade detection and hence the immune response. Evasion of the immune response is a significant event tumour development and considered one of the hallmarks of cancer. To avoid immune recognition, tumours employ a multitude of strategies with most resulting in a down-regulation of the MHC class I expression at the cell surface, significantly impairing the ability of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes to recognize the tumour. Alteration of the expression of key players in antigen processing not only affects MHC class I expression but also significantly alters the repertoire of peptides being presented. These modified peptide repertoires may serve to further reduce the presentation of tumour-specific/associated antigenic epitopes to aid immune evasion and tumour progression. Here we review the modifications to the antigen processing and presentation pathway in tumours and how it affects the anti-tumour immune response, considering the role of tumour-infiltrating cell populations and highlighting possible future therapeutic targets.},

  abstract = {The question whether a protein can be processed and resulting peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is of high importance for immunotherapy design. MHC ligands can be predicted by in silico peptide-MHC class-I binding prediction algorithms. However, there are considerable differences in prediction performance, depending on the selected algorithm, MHC class-I type and peptide length. We evaluated the prediction performance of 13 algorithms based on binding affinity data of 8-11-mer peptides derived from the HPV16 E6 and E7 proteins to the most prevalent human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types. Peptides from high to low predicted binding likelihood were synthesized and their HLA binding experimentally verified by in vitro competitive binding assays. Based on the actual binding capacity of the peptides, the performance of prediction algorithms was analyzed by calculating receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and the area under the curve (AROC). No algorithm outperformed others, but different algorithms predicted best for particular HLA types and peptide lengths. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of decision thresholds were calculated. Commonly used decision thresholds yielded only 40\% sensitivity. To increase sensitivity, optimal thresholds were calculated, validated and compared. In order to make maximal use of online available prediction algorithms, we developed MHCcombine, a web application that allows simultaneous querying and output combination of up to 13 prediction algorithms. Taken together, we here provide an evaluation of peptide-MHC class-I binding prediction tools and recommendations how to increase prediction sensitivity to extend the number of potential epitopes applicable as targets for immunotherapy.},

  abstract = {Long INterspersed Element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) retrotransposons form the only autonomously active family of transposable elements in humans. They are expressed and mobile in the germline, in embryonic stem cells and in the early embryo, but are silenced in most somatic tissues. Consistently, they play an important role in individual genome variations through insertional mutagenesis and sequence transduction, which occasionally lead to novel genetic diseases. In addition, they are reactivated in nearly half of the human epithelial cancers, contributing to tumor genome dynamics. The L1 element codes for two proteins, ORF1p and ORF2p, which are essential for its mobility. ORF1p is an RNA-binding protein with nucleic acid chaperone activity and ORF2p possesses endonuclease and reverse transcriptase activities. These proteins and the L1 RNA assemble into a ribonucleoprotein particle (L1 RNP), considered as the core of the retrotransposition machinery. The L1 RNP mediates the synthesis of new L1 copies upon cleavage of the target DNA and reverse transcription of the L1 RNA at the target site. The L1 element takes benefit of cellular host factors to complete its life cycle, however several cellular pathways also limit the cellular accumulation of L1 RNPs and their deleterious activities. Here, we review the known cellular host factors and pathways that regulate positively or negatively L1 retrotransposition at post-transcriptional level, in particular by interacting with the L1 machinery or L1 replication intermediates; and how they contribute to control L1 activity in somatic cells.},

Here, using a PCR-based targeted bulk sequencing approach, we profiled 9,181 somatic insertions from 20 postmortem tissues from five Rett patients and their matched healthy controls.

We observed a significant increase of somatic L1Hs insertions in the brain compared with non-brain tissues from the same individual. Compared to germline insertions, somatic insertions were less sense-depleted to transcripts, indicating that they underwent weaker selective pressure on the orientation of insertion. Our observations demonstrate that somatic L1Hs insertions contribute to genomic diversity and MeCP2 dysfunction alters their genomic patterns in Rett patients.},

The 5' UTR is followed by two long open reading frames, ORF1 and ORF2, which are separated from each other by an inter-ORF region of 33 nt that includes two or three in-frame stop codons. We examine here the mechanism(s) by which the translation of L1Hs ORF1 and ORF2 is initiated. A stable hairpin structure (delta G = -74.8 kcal/mol), inserted at nt 661 of the 5' UTR, caused a 3- to 8-fold decrease in the in vitro and in vivo translation of either a lacZ reporter gene for ORF1 or the ORF1 polypeptide product, p40, but translation of a lacZ reporter gene in ORF2 was increased. The results are compatible with a model for ORF1 translation initiation in which the majority of ribosomes scan from a point 5' of nt 661 but suggest that ORF2 is not translated by attached ribosomes that reinitiate after the termination of ORF1 translation. Our data are compatible with a model whereby the translation of L1Hs ORF2 is initiated internally.},

However, there is currently no comprehensive approach to identify the specific loci that are actively transcribed separate from the excess of L1-related sequences that are co-transcribed within genes. We have developed RNA-Seq procedures, as well as a 1200 bp 5΄ RACE product coupled with PACBio sequencing that can identify the specific L1 loci that contribute most of the L1-related RNA reads. At least 99\% of L1-related sequences found in RNA do not arise from the L1 promoter, instead representing pieces of L1 incorporated in other cellular RNAs.

  abstract = {The most common transposable genetic element in humans, long interspersed element 1 (L1), constitutes about 20\% of the genome. The activity of L1 and related transposons such as Alu elements causes disease and contributes to speciation. Little is known about the cellular mechanisms that control their spread. We show that expression of human APOBEC3B or APOBEC3F decreased the rate of L1 retrotransposition by 5-10-fold. Expression of two related proteins, APOBEC3D or APOBEC3G, had little effect. The mechanism of L1 inhibition did not correlate with an obvious subcellular protein distribution as APOBEC3B appeared predominantly nuclear and APOBEC3F was mostly cytosolic. Two lines of evidence indicated that these APOBEC3 proteins use a deamination-independent mechanism to inhibit L1. First, a catalytically inactive APOBEC3B mutant maintained L1 inhibition activity. Second, cDNA strand-specific C --{$>$} T hypermutations were not detected among L1 elements that had replicated in the presence of APOBEC3B or APOBEC3F. In addition, lower levels of retrotransposed L1 DNA accumulated in the presence of APOBEC3B and APOBEC3F. Together, these data combined to suggest a model in which APOBEC3B or APOBEC3F provide a preintegration barrier to L1 retrotransposition. A particularly high level of APOBEC3F protein in human testes and an inverse correlation between L1 activity and APOBEC3 gene number suggest the relevance of this mechanism to mammals.},

  abstract = {The emergence of immune checkpoint blockade therapies over the last decade has transformed cancer treatment in a wide range of tumor types. Unprecedented and durable clinical responses in difficult-to-treat cancer histologies have been observed. However, despite these promising long-term responses, the majority of patients fail to respond to immune checkpoint blockade, demonstrating primary resistance. Additionally, many of those who initially respond to treatment eventually experience relapse secondary to acquired resistance. Both primary and acquired resistance are a result of complex and constantly evolving interactions between cancer cells and the immune system. Many mechanisms of resistance have been characterized to date, and more continue to be uncovered. By elucidating and targeting mechanisms of resistance, treatments can be tailored to improve clinical outcomes. This review will discuss the landscape of immune checkpoint blockade response data, different resistance mechanisms, and potential therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance.},

  abstract = {From inception, microarray analysis has facilitated discovery by associating gene expression with biological and/or clinical sample characteristics. However, gleaning biological insight from the long lists of genes generated by microarray analysis remains a significant challenge. In this issue of PNAS, Subramanian et al. (1) describe and validate gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), a computational method that helps rapidly connect gene expression with biology and promises to be a valuable addition to publicly available computational resources.

Early on, investigators adapted unsupervised computational methods such as hierarchical clustering (2) and self-organized maps (3) to arrange genes and samples in groups or clusters based solely on the similarity of their gene expression. These methods successfully revealed the orchestrated gene expression underlying basic cellular processes such as yeast replication (4), fibroblast cell proliferation (5), and hematopoietic differentiation (3), and they continue to be used widely today. Unsupervised methods are unbiased and remain important tools for class discovery.

Alternatively, supervised methods of analysis use sample classifiers along with gene expression to rapidly identify hypothesis-driven correlations (i.e., tumor v. normal, pathological grade, recurrent disease, histological category, etc.). A few examples of supervised methods of analysis include significance analysis of microarray (SAM) (6), class prediction (7), support vector machines (8), and probit regression analysis (9, 10). In the field of oncology, supervised methods of gene expression have successfully identified novel marker genes for diagnosis (11), prognosis (12), and therapeutic response (13). Supervised methods can help overcome obfuscating technical or biological variation in gene expression and continue to identify important associations between sample phenotypes and gene expression.

GSEA represents an innovative method of supervised analysis. This analysis is performed by ( i ) ranking all genes in the data set based on their correlation to the chosen phenotype, ( ii ) identifying the rank positions of all members of the gene \ldots{}},

We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common.

In this paper Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) models are cast as infinite mixture models and inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo is described. The specification of the priors on the model parameters is often guided by mathematical and practical convenience. The primary goal of this paper is to compare the choice of conjugate and non-conjugate base distributions on a particular class of DPM models which is widely used in applications, the Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model (DPGMM). We compare computational efficiency and modeling performance of DPGMM defined using a conjugate and a conditionally conjugate base distribution.

This paper extends Ferguson's result to cases where the random measure is a mixing distribution for a parameter which determines the distribution from which observations are made. The conditional distribution of the random measure, given the observations, is no longer that of a simple Dirichlet process, but can be described as being a mixture of Dirichlet processes. This paper gives a formal definition for these mixtures and develops several theorems about their properties, the most important of which is a closure property for such mixtures. Formulas for computing the conditional distribution are derived and applications to problems in bio-assay, discrimination, regression, and mixing distributions are given.},

  title = {A {{Bayesian Analysis}} of {{Some Nonparametric Problems}}},
  volume = {1},
  issn = {0090-5364, 2168-8966},
  abstract = {The Bayesian approach to statistical problems, though fruitful in many ways, has been rather unsuccessful in treating nonparametric problems. This is due primarily to the difficulty in finding workable prior distributions on the parameter space, which in nonparametric ploblems is taken to be a set of probability distributions on a given sample space. There are two desirable properties of a prior distribution for nonparametric problems. (I) The support of the prior distribution should be large--with respect to some suitable topology on the space of probability distributions on the sample space. (II) Posterior distributions given a sample of observations from the true probability distribution should be manageable analytically. These properties are antagonistic in the sense that one may be obtained at the expense of the other. This paper presents a class of prior distributions, called Dirichlet process priors, broad in the sense of (I), for which (II) is realized, and for which treatment of many nonparametric statistical problems may be carried out, yielding results that are comparable to the classical theory. In Section 2, we review the properties of the Dirichlet distribution needed for the description of the Dirichlet process given in Section 3. Briefly, this process may be described as follows. Let X\textbackslash{}mathscr\{X\}\textbackslash{}mathscr\{X\} be a space and A\textbackslash{}mathscr\{A\}\textbackslash{}mathscr\{A\} a {$\sigma\backslash$}sigma\textbackslash{}sigma-field of subsets, and let {$\alpha\backslash$}alpha\textbackslash{}alpha be a finite non-null measure on (X,A)(\textbackslash{}mathscr\{X\}, \textbackslash{}mathscr\{A\})(\textbackslash{}mathscr\{X\}, \textbackslash{}mathscr\{A\}). Then a stochastic process PPP indexed by elements AAA of A\textbackslash{}mathscr\{A\}\textbackslash{}mathscr\{A\}, is said to be a Dirichlet process on (X,A)(\textbackslash{}mathscr\{X\}, \textbackslash{}mathscr\{A\})(\textbackslash{}mathscr\{X\}, \textbackslash{}mathscr\{A\}) with parameter {$\alpha\backslash$}alpha\textbackslash{}alpha if for any measurable partition (A1,{$\cdots$},Ak)(A\_1, \textbackslash{}cdots, A\_k)(A\_1, \textbackslash{}cdots, A\_k) of X\textbackslash{}mathscr\{X\}\textbackslash{}mathscr\{X\}, the random vector (P(A1),{$\cdots$},P(Ak))(P(A\_1), \textbackslash{}cdots, P(A\_k))(P(A\_1), \textbackslash{}cdots, P(A\_k)) has a Dirichlet distribution with parameter ({$\alpha$}(A1),{$\cdots$},{$\alpha$}(Ak)).P(\textbackslash{}alpha(A\_1), \textbackslash{}cdots, \textbackslash{}alpha(A\_k)). P(\textbackslash{}alpha(A\_1), \textbackslash{}cdots, \textbackslash{}alpha(A\_k)). P may be considered a random probability measure on (X,A)(\textbackslash{}mathscr\{X\}, \textbackslash{}mathscr\{A\})(\textbackslash{}mathscr\{X\}, \textbackslash{}mathscr\{A\}), The main theorem states that if PPP is a Dirichlet process on (X,A)(\textbackslash{}mathscr\{X\}, \textbackslash{}mathscr\{A\})(\textbackslash{}mathscr\{X\}, \textbackslash{}mathscr\{A\}) with parameter {$\alpha\backslash$}alpha\textbackslash{}alpha, and if X1,{$\cdots$},XnX\_1, \textbackslash{}cdots, X\_nX\_1, \textbackslash{}cdots, X\_n is a sample from PPP, then the posterior distribution of PPP given X1,{$\cdots$},XnX\_1, \textbackslash{}cdots, X\_nX\_1, \textbackslash{}cdots, X\_n is also a Dirichlet process on (X,A)(\textbackslash{}mathscr\{X\}, \textbackslash{}mathscr\{A\})(\textbackslash{}mathscr\{X\}, \textbackslash{}mathscr\{A\}) with a parameter {$\alpha$}+{$\sum$}1n{$\delta$}xi\textbackslash{}alpha + \textbackslash{}sum\^n\_1 \textbackslash{}delta\_\{x\_i\}\textbackslash{}alpha + \textbackslash{}sum\^n\_1 \textbackslash{}delta\_\{x\_i\}, where {$\delta$}x\textbackslash{}delta\_x\textbackslash{}delta\_x denotes the measure giving mass one to the point xxx. In Section 4, an alternative definition of the Dirichlet process is given. This definition exhibits a version of the Dirichlet process that gives probability one to the set of discrete probability measures on (X,A)(\textbackslash{}mathscr\{X\}, \textbackslash{}mathscr\{A\})(\textbackslash{}mathscr\{X\}, \textbackslash{}mathscr\{A\}). This is in contrast to Dubins and Freedman [2], whose methods for choosing a distribution function on the interval [0, 1] lead with probability one to singular continuous distributions. Methods of choosing a distribution function on [0, 1] that with probability one is absolutely continuous have been described by Kraft [7]. The general method of choosing a distribution function on [0, 1], described in Section 2 of Kraft and van Eeden [10], can of course be used to define the Dirichlet process on [0, 1]. Special mention must be made of the papers of Freedman and Fabius. Freedman [5] defines a notion of tailfree for a distribution on the set of all probability measures on a countable space X\textbackslash{}mathscr\{X\}\textbackslash{}mathscr\{X\}. For a tailfree prior, posterior distribution given a sample from the true probability measure may be fairly easily computed. Fabius [3] extends the notion of tailfree to the case where X\textbackslash{}mathscr\{X\}\textbackslash{}mathscr\{X\} is the unit interval [0, 1], but it is clear his extension may be made to cover quite general X\textbackslash{}mathscr\{X\}\textbackslash{}mathscr\{X\}. With such an extension, the Dirichlet process would be a special case of a tailfree distribution for which the posterior distribution has a particularly simple form. There are disadvantages to the fact that PPP chosen by a Dirichlet process is discrete with probability one. These appear mainly because in sampling from a PPP chosen by a Dirichlet process, we expect eventually to see one observation exactly equal to another. For example, consider the goodness-of-fit problem of testing the hypothesis H0H\_0H\_0 that a distribution on the interval [0, 1] is uniform. If on the alternative hypothesis we place a Dirichlet process prior with parameter {$\alpha\backslash$}alpha\textbackslash{}alpha itself a uniform measure on [0, 1], and if we are given a sample of size n{$\geqq$}2n \textbackslash{}geqq 2n \textbackslash{}geqq 2, the only nontrivial nonrandomized Bayes rule is to reject H0H\_0H\_0 if and only if two or more of the observations are exactly equal. This is really a test of the hypothesis that a distribution is continuous against the hypothesis that it is discrete. Thus, there is still a need for a prior that chooses a continuous distribution with probability one and yet satisfies properties (I) and (II). Some applications in which the possible doubling up of the values of the observations plays no essential role are presented in Section 5. These include the estimation of a distribution function, of a mean, of quantiles, of a variance and of a covariance. A two-sample problem is considered in which the Mann-Whitney statistic, equivalent to the rank-sum statistic, appears naturally. A decision theoretic upper tolerance limit for a quantile is also treated. Finally, a hypothesis testing problem concerning a quantile is shown to yield the sign test. In each of these problems, useful ways of combining prior information with the statistical observations appear. Other applications exist. In his Ph. D. dissertation [1], Charles Antoniak finds a need to consider mixtures of Dirichlet processes. He treats several problems, including the estimation of a mixing distribution, bio-assay, empirical Bayes problems, and discrimination problems.},

  title = {Chromosome Instability Accounts for Reverse Metastatic Outcomes of Pediatric and Adult Synovial Sarcomas},
  volume = {31},
  issn = {1527-7755},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: Synovial sarcoma (SS) occurs in both children and adults, although metastatic events are much more common in adults. Whereas the importance of the t(X;18) translocation in SS oncogenesis is well established, the genetic basis of SS metastasis is still poorly understood. We recently reported expression (CINSARC; Complexity Index in Sarcoma) and Genomic Index prognostic signatures related to chromosome integrity in sarcomas and GI stromal tumors. Here we investigate whether these signatures can also predict outcomes in SS.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred patients who had primary untreated SS tumors were selected for expression and genomic profiling in a training/validation approach.
RESULTS: CINSARC and Genomic Index have strong independent and validated prognostic values (P {$<$} .001). By comparing expression profiles of tumors with or without metastasis, 14 genes that are common to the CINSARC signature were identified, and the two top-ranked genes, KIF14 and CDCA2, were validated as prognostic markers in an independent cohort. Comparing genomic profiles of adult versus pediatric SS, we show that metastasis is associated with genome complexity in both situations and that the adult genome is more frequently rearranged. Accordingly, pediatric patients with an even genomic profile do not develop metastasis.
CONCLUSION: Metastasis development in SS is strongly associated with chromosome complexity, and CINSARC and Genomic Index are validated independent prognostic factors. The differences in metastasis frequency between adults and children are associated with genome instability, which is much more frequent in adults. Genomic Index is potentially the best overall biomarker and clearly the most clinically relevant, considering that genome profiling from formalin-fixed samples is already used in pathology.},

  title = {The {{JAK1}}/{{JAK2}}- Inhibitor Ruxolitinib Inhibits Mast Cell Degranulation and Cytokine Release},
  volume = {48},
  issn = {1365-2222},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mastocytosis is characterized by the accumulation of aberrant mast cells (MC). Patients suffering from mastocytosis suffer from a wide range of symptoms due to increased levels of MC mediators. It would therefore be of great benefit to inhibit MC mediator release. However, to date there are few drugs available that are known to effectively lower MC mediator levels. The evidence for the involvement of the janus kinase 2 (JAK2)-signal transducer and activation of transcription 5 (STAT5) signalling pathway in MC activation is slowly accumulating. Interference with the JAK2-STAT5 pathway might inhibit MC mediator release. Ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, indeed decreases symptoms like pruritus and fatigue in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms. Yet, detailed studies on how ruxolitinib affects human mast cell activity are lacking.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of JAK1/2-inhibition with ruxolitinib in the human mast cell lines LAD2 and HMC1.
METHODS: LAD2 and HMC1 were stimulated with substance P, codeine or the calcium ionophore A23817. The effect of ruxolitinib on mast cell degranulation (via measurement of {$\beta$}-hexosaminidase, histamine release and CD63 membrane expression) and IL-6, IL-13, MCP-1 and TNF-{$\alpha$} production was investigated. The involvement of STAT5 activation was explored using the selective STAT5 inhibitor pimozide.
RESULTS: Ruxolitinib effectively inhibited codeine- and substance P-induced degranulation in a concentration-dependent manner. Ruxolitinib also significantly inhibited the production of IL-6, TNF-{$\alpha$} and MCP-1 as induced by A23817 and substance P. Selective STAT5 inhibition with pimozide resulted in diminished degranulation and inhibition of cytokine production as induced by A23817 and substance P.
CONCLUSIONS \& CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study demonstrates that the JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib can inhibit MCactivity, possibly through prevention of STAT5 activation. This renders the JAK-STAT pathway as an interesting target for therapy to release symptom burden in mastocytosis and many other MC mediator-related diseases.},
