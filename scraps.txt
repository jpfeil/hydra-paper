\subsection*{Precision medicine needs more sophisticated models that can learn cancer subtypes}

\subsubsection*{Mixture Model is able to deconvolute expression modes}
We developed a simple Bayesian mixture model using the STAN bayesian modeling software \cite{stan}

Whether pediatric cancer in general has a significant immune component is an active area or research. The success of checkpoint therapies in adult cancers has not been as strongly adopted in pediatric cancers because these therapies tend to do better in patients with a high mutation burden. Pediatric cancers generally have low mutation burdens. However, several groups have found elevated checkpoint marker expression in pediatric cancers \cite{majzner2017assessment,saletta2017programmed,nowicki2016prospective}, which suggests that immunosuppressive mechanisms are active in pediatric cancers and may need further characterization to identify therapeutic opportunities. 

We show that the hydra approach is able to subtype patients using immune gene sets in a way that correlates with the computational staining of haemotoxylin and eosin (H\&E) staining. We analyzed the TCGA skin cutaneous melanoma data set (TODO: N=X)

\subsection*{Neuroblastoma Transposable Element Analysis}
One theory for way ATRX deleted samples have higher immune marker infiltrate is that dysregulation of ATRX function leads to increased expression of transposable elements which induces a DAMP response. Transposable elements have been shown to induce innate and adaptive immune responses, so the nature of the transposable elements may play a role in the type of immune response the occurs. The transposable element sequences may lead to the generation of antigens that can be used for treatment of neuroblastoma. 

In order to investigate the transposable element expression in neuroblastoma, we applied two state-of-the-art methods. The first is the salmonTE algorithm and the second is the BLANK algorithm. We used two background cohorts to quantify transposable element expression. The first is tissue matched patients that were identified as having significantly lower expression of immune markers. The second is the UVM TCGA cohort which has been used in other studies as a negative control for immune active tumors \cite{bindea2013spatiotemporal,thorsson2018immune}.
